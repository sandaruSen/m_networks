RL,reinforcement learning,DEV-6179,"At the same time , no data or < < right answer > > is provided to training procedure , which distinguishes RL from standard supervised learning ."
MPI,message passing interface,DEV-6180,Scaling and efficiency are relative to the 1 node case ( 24 MPI processes ) .
RC,rate constrained,DEV-6181,"The objectives are determining the next maximum allowable sampling instant of each plant , , and minimizing aggregate power consumption in uplink and downlink subject to the dynamics and desired performance requirement of each plant , QoS of RC users , power and sub - carrier constraints ."
MAC,medium access control,DEV-6182,"For ease of description , we name each transmission window as one Txframe , which includes handshaking and payload portions , but excludes the contention window(It should be noted that the notion of frame does not necessarily indicate a time division MAC structure . ) ."
SP,shortest path,DEV-6183,"The SP , with minimum value of is chosen for routing of the data through the network and it can be represented as , Similarly , the SP with maximum value of can be denoted as ( max ) ."
CAS,consensus attention sum,DEV-6184,Our CAS Reader is closely related to the work by kadlec - etal-2016 .
BR,bug reports,DEV-6185,"If a bug report contains one or more program elements ( method invocations , package names , source file name ) but no stack traces in the texts , then it is classified into BR ."
CAS,computer algebra systems,DEV-6186,and references therein discuss simplification techniques in CAS systems further .
LP,linear programming,DEV-6187,"On the other hand , since is symmetric , and is a feasible solution of the dual LP ."
CFD,computational fluid dynamics,DEV-6188,"Incidentally , the MAP estimate matches more closely with the CFD results compared to PSP ."
