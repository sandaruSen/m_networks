Pathological stage T1 N2 M0. OTHER DIAGNOSES: 1. Hypertension. 2. Stable ascending thoracic aneurysm. 3. History of smoking. PROCEDURES: On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005: Right exploratory thoracotomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection."
1,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Echocardiogram was negative. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute infarction in the middle carotid area, leading to left facial drooping and mild weakness of the left arm and left leg barely detectable. 2. Herpes zoster in the right T1 to T4 area, including the arm and mid- back. 3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled. 4. Obesity."
2,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Left upper extremity weakness and numbness superimposed on T1 distribution, left upper extremity pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for rheumatoid arthritis, tobacco abuse and alcohol use."
3,T1,thoracic (level) 1,A head CT without contrast demonstrated no acute abnormality. Cervical spine films raised a question of soft tissue swelling posteriorly. A CT through the cervical spine from C2 to T1 demonstrated no apparent fracture or subluxation per ER physician. It is noted that the patient underwent a brain MRI with and without contrast earlier today apparently to evaluate a movement disorder.
4,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"He was seen by his family practitioner earlier today who obtained an MRI/MRA at the T2 level what appears to be non-enhancing mass involving the T2, as well as parts of the T1, and T3 vertebra. There is a mass effect upon the thecal sac in a somewhat circumferential fashion. After the scan was performed apparently the family physician by report talked to a Neurosurgeon up in _%#CITY#%_."
5,T1,T1 (MRI),"Left lung remains clear. 6. MRI of the abdomen performed on _%#MMDD2006#%_. Conclusion is a quiet hemachromatosis of the liver and spleen. Possible hepatic cirrhosis with multinodular appearance on noncontrast T1 weighted images that may represent regenerating nodules. Cannot evaluate the liver for advancing nodules, however. If clinically indicated, a contrast enhanced CT could be performed prior to a planned dialysis."
6,T1,T1 (MRI),"This may represent metastases or postinfectious process. An MRI of the right left was done, which showed 4.6 x 4.7 x 7.5 cm high-grade tumor consistent with high grade osteosarcoma. There were 2 subcutaneous lymph nodes within the popliteal fossa. There was an ill-defined focal patchy T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity within the medial femoral condyle of the right knee of uncertain clinical significance. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.

10,T1,T1 (MRI),"An MRI was then accomplished in the evening of _%#MMDD2006#%_, which showed a mass in the midline anterosuperior cerebellar vermis which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images and hypointense on T1 weighted images, measuring 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.7 cm. There was another focal area of enhancement lateral to this mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere measuring 2.6 x 1 x 0.8 cm, which was not well-identified on the unenhanced images."
11,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"She denies pain with movement. She has no difficulty swallowing or breathing. Previous MRIs in _%#MM#%_ showed a mass at the C2 vertebral body and T1 vertebral body. The MRI was consistent with extensive mets to the skeleton, subcutaneous tissue, and adrenal glands. Since her diagnosis on _%#MMDD#%_, she has been treated with one cycle of Taxol and carboplatin."
12,T1,tumor stage 1,"PROBLEM: Acute myeloid leukemia. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. _%#NAME#%_ is a 68-year-old who has a history of T1 N0 left breast cancer diagnosed in 2000. She underwent lumpectomy, radiation and chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan. She has had no recurrence of her breast cancer, however, in _%#MM2005#%_ she was found to have falling blood counts."
13,T1,tumor stage 1,"On serial CT scanning, the lung nodule increased in size and on _%#MMDD2003#%_ he underwent right lower lobe wedge resection followed by right lower lobe lobectomy with lymph node dissection for what was found to be a T1 N0 M0 non-small cell carcinoma of the right lower lobe. Postoperatively, he has had a small pneumothorax on the right. Yesterday evening, he took a pain pill p.o. and shortly thereafter developed some mild ""itching all over."" He received IV Benadryl."
14,T1,thoracic (level) 1,7. No evidence of spinal cord or nerve root compression. 8. Sclerotic focus in the anterior aspect of the T2 vertebral body. 9. C-spine showed abnormal contrast enhancement throughout the T1 vertebral body and posterior elements. 10. Broad-based posterior disk bulge with superimposed focal disk herniation and posterior osteophyte formation in C4 and C5 resulting in mild spinal cord impingement.
15,T1,tumor stage 1,ECG sinus bradycardia with no signs of any acute or chronic ischemia. IMPRESSION/PLAN: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 56-year-old White male with a left T1 and 2A squamous cell carcinoma of the piriform sinus scheduled to undergo a left modified radical neck dissection. At a later date this will be followed by radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy.
16,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"When she was admitted to the neurology service, examination was consistent with T5 paraplegia with a sensory level and no movement of bilateral lower extremities. She had MRI of the brain, C,T and L-spine done the morning of admission showed greater than than 25 foci of T2 hyperintensities within the cerebral white matter,diffuse atrophy of the cervical cord most prominent at C7 through mid T2, multiple foci of irregular contrast enhancement in the cervical spinal cord at C7 through T1, diffuse atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord and focal region of circumferal enhancement at T7.

We were asked to see the patient postoperatively for general medical care with particular regard to known history of reactive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea."
18,T1,T1 (MRI),The CT scan of the head revealed a normal exam. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine revealed a thin epidural fluid collection that appeared bright on the T1 and T2 sequences. The Neuroradiology fellow thought this was consistent with an epidural hematoma but because of the contrast agent given could not rule out completely an epidural abscess.
19,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Sensation was present in the left paraspinal area. However, it was absent in the left arm, including the C6,7,8, and T1 dermatomes. The T2 dermatome in the axilla was intact. She had no C-spine discomfort. She had full active range of motion of her C-spine, and had no midline tenderness of her C-spine."
20,T1,T1 (MRI),"He denies any pain or constitutional symptoms. MRI showed a large anterior medial thigh consistent with intramuscular lipoma. There is intense fat on T1 and T2 imaging. It is intermittently associated with femoral vessels, but does not encase these structures. It is likely an intramuscular lipoma. This may be an atypical presentation that has recurred significantly over a relatively short period of time."

26,T1,T1 (MRI),"The patient was again partially controlled up until recently. She decided to ask to have re-imaging of her brain to help with possible control of her seizures. The MRI showed a lesion that was isointense with T1 and hyperintense with T2 weighted imaging. It did not enhance with gadolinium contrast, and she has a swollen hippocampal lobe."
27,T1,T1 (MRI),"He has extensive osteoarthritic changes. The axial images are compromised secondary to motion artifact, although they do demonstrate primarily foraminal rather than central stenosis. His T1 images do not demonstrate significant central stenosis, particularly at the level of his cord atrophy. The area of most stenosis centrally appears to be C3-4."

The patient was left with positive margins at her most recent surgery. We therefore the patient should receive postoperative radiation therapy. We feel both sides of her neck would be at risk at this point, and would recommend radiation therapy to the bilateral neck, as well as supraclavicular region and would include the oral tongue and the field."
32,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"He is appropriate and communicative. He has unlabored breathing. EXTREMITIES: RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY: The patient is right hand dominant. His sensation is intact from C5 to T1 and sensation is normal over the thumb, palmar, radial, and ulnar surfaces. He has 5/5 strength in his biceps, wrist extension, and flexion of triceps."

The patient had a diagnoses of T1 carcinoma of the floor of the mouth. He has only 1 functioning carotid artery because the right carotid artery is totally occluded.
43,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 45-year-old patient with a history of an epidural esophageal fistula status post C7 infusion in 2004. He underwent a T1 to T12 laminectomy for evacuation of an epidural abscess in 2007. He is well known to the Thoracic service for esophageal leak, and despite multiple stent placements, he has had a persistent esophageal cutaneous fistula."
44,T1,T1 (MRI),"MRI scan was personally reviewed. It showed normal T1 images but T2 images demonstrate normal myelination in the rostrum and the finding of the corpus callosum, mildly delayed myelination and thinning of the intra and posterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally and significant decreased significant on flare and T2 weighted image only in the centrum semiovale. The T1 image looks normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 111/77."

This was treated in 2002, by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ with a partial glossectomy and ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection."
46,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Of note: On her cervical CT imaging, there appears to be mass behind more prominently the body of C4 through the superior portion of the body of T1. In order to clarify this, emergent MRI scanning was done, there is certainly a mass from C4 through the superior portion of T1 that has a consistency of that of acute blood by MRI imaging. A differential diagnosis would, however, include a spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma versus cervical epidural empyema versus a possible extramedullary tumor that has possibly bled."
47,T1,T1 (MRI),"LABORATORY DATA: Pending. Her MRI of her brain as in the history of present illness shows infiltrative lesion in the right petrous apex extending to the right cavernous sinus and right clivus best seen on precontrast T1 weighted images, suspicious for metastatic breast cancer. Bone scan per Dr. _%#NAME#%_ three weeks ago was negative per Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s report to her. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: A 52-year-old patient with probable metastatic lesion from breast cancer which now is in a difficult spot to biopsy."

50,T3,triiodothyronine,"Possibly related to situational stress. Would monitor clinically for now. 5. Suppressed TSH with normal free thyroxine. Will check T3 to ensure not hyperthyroid (doubt clinically). 6. History of childhood seizure disorder, quiescent into adulthood. PLAN: 1. Psychiatric intervention as per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Agree with workup for underlying organic cause for psychosis as I suspect this has not been done previously."
51,T3,triiodothyronine,"Upon discharge, the heparin and Coumadin were stopped. Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism: This patient had a low TSH, a high-normal T4, and a normal T3. The cause of the low TSH was not found. However, a thyroid ultrasound showed the presence of a thyroid nodule."
52,T3,triiodothyronine,Normal electrolytes. Improvement in pre- renal azotemia preoperatively with a BUN of 13 and creatinine of 0.7. Off of diuretic therapy. Normal thyroid function as above including normal T3 of 2.5. Follow-up chest x-ray _%#MMDD#%_ demonstrating no active disease. Felt clinically stable for discharge back to the nursing home.

T3 uptake 55 with reference range between 23 to 37. It should be noted that the above laboratories were drawn on _%#MMDD2003#%_.
56,T3,triiodothyronine,"That admission she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%, BNP in the 500s, and a chest x-ray that showed a left-sided pleural effusion. She was admitted for further workup. During that stay, she had an undetectable TSH, with an elevated T3 and T4 consistent with hyperthyroidism. A chest CT showed hilar adenopathy and patchy bilateral infiltrates. The patient was treated with Lasix, Coreg, and lisinopril. Her symptoms improved, and she was sent home for follow- up."

IMPRESSION: The patient is a 51-year-old male with non-small cell lung carcinoma, stage IIB (T3, N0, M0) with right apical lung mass abutting, but not invading T2 vertebral body and head of first rib. RECOMMENDATIONS: We are planning to treat the patient with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and have consented him this morning."
58,T3,tumor stage 3,"HISTORY: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 78-year-old patient who had undergone an aorto, right common femoral, left profunda femoral bypass and a left graft to mid superficial femoral PTFE bypass on _%#MMDD2003#%_. He has also undergone a left pneumonectomy on _%#MMDD2004#%_ for a T3 N1 M0 small cell carcinoma. The patient has developed hip pain and CT scan is indicative of metastatic disease to his hip and pelvis."
59,T3,tumor stage 3,"I am asked to see the patient by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and the primary medical team regarding his worrisome imaging studies which suggest metastatic cancer. In brief, the patient is a 75-year-old white male with a past medical history of a stage I to II (T3 N0 M0) right-sided colon cancer which was treated with hemicolectomy in 1999. He also has had prostate cancer and has underlying coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus."
60,T3,triiodothyronine,"Endocrinology was consulted regarding these findings. They recommended repeating the TSH with a free T4 as well as a T3 level. His T3 level was noted to be normal at 88. It was, therefore, the opinion of the Endocrinology Service that this likely represented euthyroid sick syndrome."
61,T3,triiodothyronine,"Based on laboratory data from the outside hospital, she has hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism: Based on decreased TSH and high T3 and T4, she has hyperthyroidism. Currently she is not in acute thyroid toxicosis. She has sinus tachycardia and does not have atrial fibrillation."
62,T3,triiodothyronine,"Abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Lower extremities have no edema, no masses. Neurologically the patient was intact.

63,T3,triiodothyronine,Endocrinology had recommended PTU at 100 mg q.i.d. and followup for radioactive iodine ablation in 2-4 weeks. There is no indication at this point for repeating her thyroid uptake scan or thyroid ultrasound. We will check a T3 and T4 level for completeness sake and will check a thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin and thyroid antibody tests. She will likely follow up with HealthPartners Endocrinology. 5. Hypertension which certainly could be contributing to her predisposition to atrial fibrillation.
64,T3,triiodothyronine,"LABS: Which were from _%#MMDD2007#%_, sodium 140, potassium 2.6, chloride 109, bicarb 25, BUN 9, creatinine 0.37, glucose 140, WBC 4.4, hemoglobin 12.4, hematocrit 37.7, platelets 120. Beta HCG negative. TSH is less than 0.03, T3 is 818 and thyroxine free is 7.26. A&P: This is a 33-year-old female with hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response."
65,T3,triiodothyronine,PLAN: 1. Psychiatric intervention as per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Recheck liver profile on the morning of _%#MMDD#%_. Add T4 and T3 and RIA to further screen for hyperthyroidism. 3. Copy of lab studies to po at discharge with recommendation that she make appointment as previously advised at the Fairview Redwing Medical Center with a primary care provider.
66,T3,triiodothyronine,"In addition, her liver function tests would return to normal and hepatitis B and C serology would be negative. Also, initial TSH was low, but a repeat TSH was normal at 0.61 with a normal free T4 at 1.57 and a T3 of 116."
67,T3,triiodothyronine,"We will continue to monitor her psychologic status as this medication takes effect during her rehabilitation stay. PROBLEM #6: Endocrine. TSH was significantly decreased, however, the patient ended up having a normal T3 and T4 (TSH 0.25), T3 80, and free thyroxine 1.66. We will continue to monitor this every couple of months to make sure that the patient does not develop frank hyperthyroidism."
68,T3,triiodothyronine,"PLAN: 1. Psychiatric intervention as per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Hepatitis A, B, and C studies. 3. Limited MRI of the liver to evaluate probable cavernous hemangioma. 4. T3, IRA, and T4. 5. Sudafed and nasal salt water irrigation prn congestion. 6. Follow-up Dr. _%#NAME#%_, Fairview-University Medical Center Infectious Disease as scheduled."
69,T3,triiodothyronine,"9. Hypothyroid: Thyroid studies done on _%#MMDD2002#%_ showed the TSH to be elevated at 6.59, the FT4 low at 0.54 and the T3 to be low at 78. Endocrine was consulted and requested a thyroid ultrasound and repeat of TSH, FT4 and T3. The repeat thyroid studies were consistent with hypothyroidism and _%#NAME#%_ was started on Synthroid 3 mcg per day."
70,T3,tumor stage 3,"2. Status post implanted port placement. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 54-year-old gentleman who was initially diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the GE junction stage III (T3, N1, M0) in 2002. The patient was treated with carbo-Taxol chemotherapy initially and then concurrently with radiation to a total dose of 45 grays in 25 fractions."
71,T3,tumor stage 3,"The patient was sent home with a leg bag on _%#MMDD2004#%_ to be seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ in the near future in follow up. His path report revealed that a T3, N0, M0 lesion, which appears not to require any further treatment. He will be seen in the office in 2-3 weeks. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Foley catheter leg bag. 2. Avoidance of heavy lifting."
72,T3,tumor stage 3,"The muscle cello exam was significant for severe tenderness with external rotation of the right hip. There was also mild tenderness with flexion to 90 degrees. Palpation of the cervical spine yielded exquisite tenderness, T3. The patient localized the site of this tenderness to approximately C6 or C7. There was point tenderness to palpation throughout the thoracic spine."
73,T3,thoracic (level) 3,"Unfortunately, with his steroid therapy and radiation therapy, he had little improvement in his lower extremity weakness. He was evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ of neurosurgery and the patient did agree to a spinal decompression at the level T3 and T4. This was done 5 days ago. Unfortunately, he has shown little improvement of his lower extremity weakness."
74,T3,triiodothyronine,"2. Endocrine. _%#NAME#%_ was initially placed on insulin drip, and this was titrated, based upon her serum and fingerstick glucoses and eventually switched over to IM Glargine and Humalog as her blood glucose control improved. She had multiple endocrine labs drawn during her admission including an islet cell antibody of the less than 1:4 ratio, insulin antibodies less than 3, C-Peptide to 3.6, T3 less than 40, free T4 1.07 with a TSH of 1.16. 3. CV/Respiratory. Stable. 4. GI/GU. _%#NAME#%_ was continued on her tacrolimus with levels varying from 10.9-14.0 during her admission."
75,T3,triiodothyronine,"1. Advair Diskus in addition to albuterol inhaler as prescribed. 2. We will add onto labs free thyroxine as well as T3 give patient a copy of labs in order to have when following up with outpatient physician, who has monitored her hypothyroidism in the past."
76,T3,triiodothyronine,"5. History of hypothyroidism. The patient did have thyroid studies done. These showed a TSH of 0.84 and a free thyroxin of 1.44. Her free T3 was 1.7. However, with her TSH being in the normal range, we will continue her on her same dose of thyroid hormone on discharge."
77,T3,tumor stage 3,"Pathology report showed papillary urothelial carcinoma, high grade. The tumor focally invades into the renal interstitium in the ureter. The tumor invades into the lamina propria and submucosa without evidence of smooth muscle involvement. Pathologic staging is T3. Surgical margins were negative. Prior to his surgery the patient did require a blood transfusion and was transfused 2 units of blood."
78,T3,triiodothyronine,"There is no pitting edema noted. Neurovascular is intact. Neck reveals mildly enlarged thyroid with no nodule palpable on examination. PLANS FOR DISCHARGE: 1. Hyperthyroidism with TSH of less than 0.02. Labs pending include a free T3, free T4, and thyroid antibodies. The patient is to follow up with endocrinology at the University of Minnesota on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, at 10 a.m. This information was given to the patient and recommended to follow up there to discuss treatment options."

80,T3,triiodothyronine,"She remained afebrile during the course of her hospitalization. Blood pressures were all within normal limits. Oral intake was good. Abdominal exam remained benign. Thyroid level, free, was 1.27 and TSH 1.6, calcium 8.8, T3 was pending. Glucose 93, BUN 6, creatinine 0.6, potassium 3.6. Blood cultures negative. Urine culture pending, apparently negative. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a previous cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, sigmoid diverticulosis."
81,T3,triiodothyronine,She has no evidence to suggest hyperaldosteronism. Her TSH was found to be a fairly low at 0.15 but the total T3 and also free T4 was found to be in tachycardia. We believe her severe hypokalemia is the results of chronic ongoing diarrhea precipitated by her recent crash dieting.
82,T3,triiodothyronine,"LUNGS: Clear bilaterally with no crackles or wheezes. ABDOMEN; Soft, nontender, nondistended with no organomegaly and no masses appreciated. There was no guarding or rebound.

Sodium is 143, potassium 4.3, chloride 110, bicarb 29, BUN 21, creatinine is 1.6 which is elevated."
83,T3,tumor stage 3,His postoperative course was uneventful. He was found to have a 3.6 cm renal cell carcinoma that had sarcomatoid features and there was focal involvement of the perirenal fat making this a stage T3 tumor. He was discharged on postoperative day #5 in excellent condition and will follow up with me in several days for staple removal.
84,T3,triiodothyronine,"Our plan for this, we will get a spot urine calcium and electrolytes, as well as send off a 24-hour urine collection for calcium. We will also check a PTH, TSH and T3 and T4 to elucidate any sort of ongoing hyperparathyroidism that would exacerbate this as well. We will also send for an ionized serum calcium, as this is mildly elevated, as well as serum phosphate."

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: The patient is a 58-year-old female with end-stage liver disease secondary to NASH."
91,T3,triiodothyronine,"The patient was followed subsequently with generally normal thyroid function since that time. She had last been seen by me on _%#MMDD2002#%_ and had normal values for a T4, T3 and TSH. She was to have seen me in the office this week for an annual reassessment. Apparently, the patient was found approximately two weeks ago or so to have again an elevation in her free T4 or suppression of her serum TSH."
92,T3,tumor stage 3,"_____ Patient examined by resident/fellow in my presence. Discussed with resident and agree with note. My key findings: CC: Stage IVA, T3, N2b, M0 squamous cell cancer of the base of tongue. Status post induction chemotherapy following ECOG protocol _%#PROTOCOL#%_. HPI: This patient with stage IV base of tongue cancer is well-known to our department."
93,T3,tumor stage 3,"The patient was diagnosed in _%#MM#%_ of 2002 with her moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and underwent endorectal ultrasound which showed evidence of a 4 by 3 cm ulcerative lesion to the left and midline of the rectum, beginning at 9 cm and extending to 13 cm. The patient was staged as a T3 lesion. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis in _%#MM#%_ of 2002 showed evidence of thickening of the rectal wall but no evidence of adenopathy."
94,T3,thoracic (level) 3,"Workup revealed relapse confirmed by a liver biopsy. He also had lung nodules at that time and 5% bone marrow involvement. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ required urgent radiation treatment due to the epidural mass at T3, T4, and T5. He received 15 radiation treatments from T2 to T6. He received a total of 3750 cGy. The radiation was effective at relieving associated pain, and he has gradually regained some of his motor function."
95,T3,tumor stage 3,"In addition, there was a Gleason of 3+4=7 on 20% on the core specimen from the left apex. He was seen in consultation by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ for discussion of possible robotic-assisted prostatectomy, however, for fear that he would have high-volume diffuse disease and possibly stage T3, the decision was made to have an open radical retropubic prostatectomy with thorough pelvic lymph node dissection. COURSE OF HOSPITALIZATION: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ underwent a radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006."
96,T3,tumor stage 3,"The lesion was consistent with invasive, moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma in association with a villous carcinoma. This was a biopsy report with the colonoscopy. The surgery was actually on _%#MMDD#%_, the tumor was 7.5 cm in length, 16.5 cm in circumference, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, mucinous component 70%, solid pattern 10%, grade II invasive through muscularis propria into the subserosa, T3, no lymphatic or vascular invasion, negative lymph nodes, 25 sampled for metastatic carcinoma, mucinous component and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes suggests possible microsatellite instability."
97,T3,triiodothyronine,"PROBLEM #5: Probable hypothyroidism. She complained of lethargy and weakness and we have ordered TSH, which was 15.2. T3 and T4 are pending on time of this dictation. Please follow these labs and repeat TSH 2 weeks later. I will put her on a low dose of Synthroid on time of discharge."

PLAN: Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and I discussed with the patient the goals, risks, benefits, and alternatives to radiation therapy."
99,T3,triiodothyronine,"LABORATORY DATA: Glucose 111, ALT 80. The rest of the comprehensive metabolic panel is negative. CBC remarkable for lymphocytes 19, otherwise normal. Reflex TSH 0.33. Otherwise, the T3 and T4 are pending. Magnesium, phosphorus and platelet count are normal. ASSESSMENT: 1. Depression. 2. Nausea. This is probably secondary to depression versus the patient's headache."
100,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"The infertility was primarily just due to the fact that she was older, as they had tried 4 attempts of insemination previously. Their daughter, _%#NAME#%_, also was conceived through IVF. I reviewed that at the age of 42 the chance of one or both babies to have any type of chromosome abnormality is approximately 1 in 20 or 5%."

104,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"Pregnancy History: G 2 P 0010 LMP: IVF pregnancy (retrieval _%#MM2006#%_) Age: 34 EDD (LMP): _%#MMDD2007#%_ Age at Delivery: 35 EDD (U/S): Gestational Age: 19+4 weeks * _%#NAME#%_ had an ectopic pregnancy. This, in addition to fallopian tube scarring from a childhood surgery necessitated IVF for the current pregnancy. Risk assessment for chromosome conditions: * We discussed the association between maternal age and an increasing risk for chromosome conditions, such as Down syndrome."
105,IVF,in vitro fertilization,The egg donor is 22 years old. _%#NAME#%_'s pregnancy history is significant for a miscarriage in _%#MM#%_ of 2006. That pregnancy was conceived with their first cycle of IVF with a donor egg. _%#NAME#%_ and _%#NAME#%_ report a history of infertility and unsuccessful intrauterine inseminations and IVF with _%#NAME#%_'s own eggs.

The mother's pregnancy was the result of IVF and was complicated by twin gestation. She presented to Fairview Ridges after spontaneous rupture of membranes and in active labor."
108,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"PROCEDURE: Repeat low transverse Cesarean birth under spinal anesthesia. HISTORY: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a patient of Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ who has been followed regularly throughout her pregnancy. She did have conception with IVF. Her first Cesarean was performed for fetal distress. She was at a playground with her four-year-old daughter, was sitting on a park bench and had spontaneous rupture of membranes."
109,IVF,in vitro fertilization,She has had four ____otropin cycles and no pregnancies. Fibers have been noted on ultrasound. We are proceeding onto myomectomy prior to her IVF consult. Patient otherwise is well. Functional inquiry shows the patient to be taking Paxil 20 mg a day.
110,IVF,intravenous fluid,"On admission electrolytes were normal except for phosphorus high at 7.7, magnesium low at 1.3, ionized calcium slightly low at 3.9 and total calcium low at 7.2. She was given a multiple doses of calcium gluconate to correct her calcium. In addition she received magnesium. She was kept NPO and IVF of D10W were started at 150cc/kg/day. By day two she began enteral feeds of EPF 20 kcal/oz formula via gavage feeds and tolerated this well; however she was not alert enough to bottle until DOL # 13 when she started to feed orally much better."
111,IVF,intravenous fluid,"Once her pain medication was changed to p.o. Dilaudid, her pain was well-controlled without GI distress, and she was discharged with p.o. Dilaudid. 4. FEN: The patient was given IVF at the time of surgery. Fluids were decreased as the patient started to tolerate increased p.o. intake. She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge."
112,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Menometrorrhagia, unresponsive to medical management. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49-year-old white female para 1,0,4,2, IVF twins at 37 weeks' gestation with a long-standing history of infertility who we have been following for menometrorrhagia that has been unresponsive to medical management.

Follow Hgb and recheck WBC in the am. 4. Substance abuse problem. The patient has history of alcohol abuse and is currently using marijuana daily and tested positive for cocaine."
116,IVF,intravenous fluid,"Subsequently, _%#NAME#%_ was placed on D12.5W IVF with gavage feedings advancing to 55 cc per 3 hours. Glucose level became normal overnight and feeding advanced while weaning IVF. Breast feeding was initiated on day #1 and advanced throughout admission while decreasing scheduled feedings. Hypoglycemia was probably due to hyperinsulinemia secondary to the mother's diabetes."
117,IVF,intravenous fluid,"A CR scan was equivocal. 3. CV: _%#NAME#%_ had two episodes of decreased blood pressures to MAP's in the mid 30's after two separated lasix doses on days #1 and 2 of hospitalization. Each episode responded well to a 20 cc/kg IVF flush. He subsequently maintained his heart rate and pressures well. Because of his unexplained oxygen desats mentioned above, _%#NAME#%_ received a cardiac echo, which was normal."
118,IVF,intravenous fluid,"Problems during the hospitalization included the following: 1. FEN: On admission to NICU she was placed NPO and given IVF overnight.

After IVF and insulin and a dose of Kayexalate, his repeat potassium was down to 4.8. Initial blood sugar in the Emergency Room was 377."
121,IVF,intravenous fluid,"Right upper quadrant ultrasound at admission demonstrated multiple gallstones. Amylase and lipase were markedly elevated. Bilirubin was also higher than usual baseline. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was made NPO and was given IV pain medications and IVF. There was no evidence for cholangitis, therefore antibiotics were not started. Gastroenterology was involved and did not want to perform urgent EUS or ERCP due to thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and recent banding of esophageal varices."
122,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"2. Preterm labor with cervical dilation of 3 cm. PROCEDURES: None.

124,IVF,UNSURED SENSE,Trophic feeds were begun on DOL #7. Feeds were advanced slowly and he was taking 22cc breast milk Q3 hours at the time of discharge IVF. TPN was discontinued on the day of transfer secondary to accidental removal of the UVC. TPN will likely need to be continued for 1-2 more days.
125,IVF,intravenous fluid,The admission physical examination was significant for subcostal retractions and increased work of breathing. Problems during the hospitalization included the following: 1. FEN: NPO on admission with IVF at 60cc/kg/day. By DOL 1 he was taking oral feedings of breast milk and Enfamil with iron 20 kcal/oz. He has bottled very well and at discharge was on ad lib demand feeds.
126,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for depression. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has had her wisdom teeth removed.

He had no problems advancing to full feeds of 40mL of breast milk and Enfamil premature formula fortified to 24kcal/ounce every three hours."
128,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"If there are any peritubal adhesions we will lyse those. If she does have clearly- significant hydrosalpinx we would ligate the tubes to prepare her for IVF. She had a consultation with the reproductive endocrinologist also, who had recommended if there was hydrosalpinx present we would ligate the tubes to prepare her for IVF."
129,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"PRENATAL CARE: Forwick Clinic with Dr. _%#NAME#%_, total weight gain was 43 pounds. Pregnancy complication included advanced maternal age which declined genetic testing and twin IUP as a result of IVF. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypothyroidism.

Breastfeedings ad lib were started prior to NICU admission on _%#MMDD#%_ and were well tolerated."
133,IVF,intravenous fluid,"The admission physical examination was significant for tachypnea, grunting, and fine crackles bilaterally, hypotonia that resolved by 45 minutes of life, and an II/VI systolic murmur. Problems during the hospitalization included the following: 1. FEN: _%#NAME#%_ was initially started on IVF, but was able to start feeds by day of life 2 when her respiratory status improved. She was able to advance to feeds of Enfamil 20 at 55ml every three hours, and was breastfeeding as well."
134,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"The _%#MMDD2007#%_, labs were done prior to the patient starting her Lovenox. IMPRESSION: 1. IVF with twin pregnancies with hyperemesis gravidarum. 2. Estrogen patch to be continued until the end of _%#MM#%_. 3. PICC line with PICC line thrombus with extensive clot present."

250,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,11. PSYCHOLOGICAL: No depression noted. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Extensive and includes: 1. Status post bilateral sequential lung transplant done on _%#MMDD2006#%_ secondary to DIP at this time. Has had questionable episode of acute rejection in _%#MM2006#%_. His DIP recurrence was documented in _%#MM2007#%_ and was treated with high-dose steroids with significant improvement in his PFTs.
251,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"X-rays of the left hand (three views) taken at Queen of Peace Hospital earlier this evening reveal a tuft fracture of the index finger. The long finger has a fracture going directly through the DIP joint. There is comminution and bone loss. IMPRESSION: Saw injury, left II/III fingertips. This patient will be taken to the Operating Room for exploration of his wounds."
252,DIP,distal interphalangeal,EXAMINATION OF The Right HAND: Reveals no abnormalities other than the index finger. There is a 5 x 15 mm. area of skin loss dorsally just radial to the DIP joint. Some of this has what appears to be underlying exposed distal phalanx. There is no exposed extensor tendon. The nail appears normal.
253,DIP,distal interphalangeal,Sensation is intact distally. He has full range of motion at the PIP and DIP. Motor is intact to his PIP and DIP joints. The bullet entered the medial aspect of the left thigh. There is an approximately 2 cm circular entrance wound. No exit wound is seen.
254,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"The germinal matrix of the nailplate does appear intact. There is bone distally. His sensation is intact to light touch. He has flexion and extension in both PIP and DIP. X-rays obtained today, multiple views in the ER show a comminuted tuft fracture which is displaced into the soft tissue."
255,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-developed, well-nourished female, who is alert and oriented x 3, and in no acute distress. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear. LEFT RING FINGER: There is an obvious flexion contracture at the DIP joint. She has tenderness dorsally. She is unable to fully extend. IMPRESSION: Soft tissue mallet. Given that the patient is a surgeon, the indication is for pinning of her DIP joint to allow her to continue to do surgery over the next four weeks."
256,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"She is otherwise healthy. She is right-hand dominant. On examination, the splint was removed. She has a healed laceration over the dorsum of the left index DIP joint. The sutures are still in the wound. There is no evidence of infection. She is unable to actively extend her DIP joint but she has full passive extension at the DIP joint as well as the PIP and MP joints."
257,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender with active bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Right index finger has swelling in the distal area with some erythema primarily around the DIP joint. She has an open wound medial to the DIP joint. Minimal proximal swelling of the finger. She had normal sensation in the finger and has normal range of motion, given the swelling."
258,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"This patient therefore presented to the emergency room earlier today with increasing problems with the digit. He was seen by the emergency room physician, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ who noted an area of dorsal epidermolysis on the DIP joint where he was cut. She unroofed this region and got some purulent material that was cultured. Because of concern over failure to respond to oral treatment, he is admitted at this time for a course of intravenous antibiotics."
259,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"There is no flank tenderness today, no CVA tenderness. There are normal bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Full and symmetric range of motion throughout. He does have the left fifth finger DIP amputation. He also has a healed anterior left shin scar. He has just a trace of effusion in both lower extremities, which apparently is chronic."
260,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"ABDOMEN: Soft, slightly round, nontender, nondistended to my exam. Bowel sounds are low-pitched and present. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Slight kyphosis. There are some arthritic changes in the DIP. LABORATORY DATA: White blood count 18.8, hemoglobin 12, MCV 87, platelets 260, INR 1.81. Electrolytes on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_: Sodium 135, potassium 4.0, chloride 102, cO2 26."
261,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"There are no ulcerations. There is no sclerodactyly. HEAD: Is normocephalic and there is no scalp tenderness. EYES: Are normal Carotids are not enlarged. The thyroid is not enlarged. UPPER EXTREMITIES: Reveal normal DIP, PIP and metacarpal phalangeal joints bilaterally. There is no synovitis or effusion. There is soft tissue swelling of the right hand from infiltrated intravenous."
262,DIP,distal interphalangeal,She has limited finger flexion and extension but only because of the mass effect dorsally. She has no significant pain with flexion or extension of the finger including the PIP and DIP as well as MP joints. Plain x-rays were obtained through the emergency department. (_______________) index finger contraction with a gross purulence dorsally.
263,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Ultimately, I think it is going to need to be fused at the DIP joints of the index and long fingers. There is the possibility of amputation if his vascularity gets worse. Right now, though, things are pink and look reasonable. Slight active bleeding was encountered."
264,DIP,distal interphalangeal,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Is significant for bilateral vein ligation. 2. She also had a L4-L5 laminectomy 3. Left index DIP fusion on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ at Fairview Southdale. MEDICATIONS: 1. She is on Zoloft 150 2. Astelin Nasal spray QD.
265,DIP,distal interphalangeal,There is significant tenderness diffusely about the volar aspect of the index finger as well as along the ulnar and dorsal ulnar aspect of the DIP joint. There is only mild pain with gentle movement of the DIP joint. The FDS and FTP flexor tendons are intact clinically. IMPRESSION: Left index finger infection involving flexor tendon synovial sheath with inadequate response to IV antibiotics over the past two days.
266,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"The patient is currently having an exacerbation of this in her feet, legs, and hands. She rates her pain as a 5/10 and is more of a burning pain. She has some redness and swelling in the DIP and PIP joints on her hands and feet. Her knees are also red. She has tried NSAID and methotrexate in the past per her rheumatologist with little success."
267,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"I took the top of the eschar material off, and there was obvious necrotic liquified tissue right down to the dorsal aspect of the DIP joint. With slight flexion of the skin, you could actually see right into the joint space. Therefore, the patient was redressed in sterile fashion and set up for admission to the hospital."
268,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"3. Orthopedic. The patient had been followed in clinic prior to her admission for a right second finger swelling at the DIP joint. She has known degenerative osteoarthritis but has not ever had swelling and pain in a joint similar to this. Orthopedic Surgery, Dr. _%#NAME#%_, did visit the patient in this visit, and felt that all of her problems were related to this degeneration, and there was no evidence of infectious etiology there."
269,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Vital signs, blood pressure 132/79, pulse 82, respirations 18, temperature 98.4. Exam of the left hand reveals no abnormalities other than the index finger. There was an oblique laceration at the level of the DIP joint with a longer radial flap. This is clean without any residual foreign material. Motion of the MP and PIP joints is full."
270,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"There was no trochanteric or other hip joint tenderness or swelling on the right or left side. Her hands including her wrists, MCP, PIP, and DIP joints were free of effusions or tenderness to palpation. However, she had Heberden's nodes on her right fifth DIP no acute distress her left fourth DIP."
271,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"As I palpate the wound, I do not get any gross purulence but there is quite a bit of drainage on the recently placed bandage except purulence. There is no signs of cellulitis extending up the arm or into the hand. It is difficult to assess the DIP joint as he is so tender to palpation of the fingertip. Otherwise, no systemic rashes or ulcerations. NEURO: Power is 5/5 throughout."
272,DIP,distal interphalangeal,This shows an amputation to his DIP joint. There is no bony injury of the middle phalanx or proximal phalanx. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: At this time is soft tissue degloving injury right small finger with amputation to the DIP joint. We discussed this at length. We discussed nonsurgical treatment which would be dressing changes and antibiotics. We discussed surgical management. We discussed the fact that replantation is likely not an option now due to the significant soft tissue crushing injury and the oblique nature of his wound edges.
273,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Cervix appears intact. Uterus is introverted, normal size. Adnexae are clear. RV confirms. EXTREMITIES: Unremarkable other than the mild tenderness and swelling in the DIP joints in both hands. She has good peripheral pulses. Her reflexes are symmetric and normoactive. Her gait is normal. LABORATORY DATA: Hemoglobin on this date was drawn and will be faxed over as well as her EKG prior to surgery."
274,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"He is S0, T0 at the PIP joints, MCP joints, right wrist, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, mid feet, and MTP joints. The left fifth finger DIP joint has moderate Heberden's node formation. LABORATORY DATA: Demonstrates a sedimentation rate of 76, performance _%#MMDD2003#%_."
275,DIP,distal interphalangeal,She will be transferred to a TCU at Masonic Home in _%#CITY#%_. The patient is currently on prednisone at 30 mg b.i.d. for treatment of DIP. I followed her for type 2 diabetes while she was in the hospital. Please see my original endocrine consultation dated _%#MMDD2006#%_ and my progress notes as well as diabetes management orders.
276,DIP,distal interphalangeal,There is no erythema pus or swelling. The skin is otherwise unremarkable. Her joints disclose typical changes of severe rheumatoid arthritis in the proximal DIP joints of her hands. Chest x-ray discloses interstitial infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
277,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"She, however, is quite obese. Examination of her upper extremity reveals that it is splinted. Her fingers are in a flexed posture as well as her fingers. In this position I am able to move her DIP quite well but her PIP joints are quite spastic. SKIN: Intact. SENSATION: Intact to light touch. Cap refill less than 2 seconds."
278,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"The amputated piece is available and was inspected. It is oblique. The level of the injury of the distal fragment involves the DIP joint, and there is moderate comminution of the bony fragment of the remaining remnant of the middle phalanx on the ulnar portion of the digit."
279,DIP,distal interphalangeal,He was admitted to the hematology/oncology service. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Left middle finger cellulitis: The patient's left middle finger was quite erythematous from the DIP joint to the MIP joint. There was also an area of the size of a penny on the dorsal aspect of his middle finger that was purplish.
280,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"There is still an open linear area along the incision and drainage plane, and he has markedly limited range of motion at the DIP and PIP joints. The digit is still about twice the size of normal. However, this all represents an improvement compared to during his hospital stay."
281,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"The patient's post-transplant course has been complicated by heart failure secondary to idiopathic cardiomyopathy. His ejection fraction is less than 25%. He also has recurrence of his DIP in his transplanted lung requiring steroid treatment. The patient was admitted 2 times in _%#MM#%_, once for atrial flutter with 2 ablations performed."
282,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"Since his last hospital admission on _%#MMDD2007#%_, he was started on 30 mg twice a day of prednisone for recurrence of DIP in his transplanted lung. He was admitted at that time for shortness of breath, which was thought to be most likely due to DIP and possibly heart failure."
283,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Grossly, sensation is intact, slightly decreased on the ulnar aspect. The second has a flap-type laceration, approximately 2 cm, starting at the PIP, flapping up over the DIP. There is a question of tenderness involvement. Neurologically he is intact grossly on this. There are some abrasions to the ring finger. X-rays are unremarkable for fracture."
284,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Lungs clear. Heart has regular rate and rhythm. Examination of his left upper extremity reveals the ring finger unable to bend at the DIP joint. He has tenderness over the proximal phalanx, and at the A1 pulley level due to some swelling. He has normal two-point discrimination distally. He has good radial and ulnar pulses."
285,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"He has discomfort with palpation of these areas of nodularity which have a whitish tint under the skin, consistent with gouty tophi. Examination of his right long finger shows a 1.5 cm area of white blistering and fluctuance dorsal to the DIP joint. It is significantly tender to palpation. He has no tenderness along the flexor or extensor tendon and no tenderness in the palm."
286,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Examination of the left hand reveals that the left 4th digit does show a mild degree of angulation as compared to the other digits. The patient does have full, unrestricted range of motion at the DIP joint as compared to the right. The patient is noted to have a significant decrease in range of motion at the left 4th IP joint."
287,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Exploration of it shows that the extensor tendon hood is severed from radial to ulnar, but is not completely severed on the most ulnar aspect, which allows her extension. Distally she can flex her DIP and her PIP joints. Remainder of her hand sensation and motor are intact. Normal wrist extension and flexion. Normal elbow motion. ASSESSMENT: Laceration of the right index finger including the extensor hood of the index finger."
288,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is status post bilateral sequential lung transplantation performed on _%#MMDD2006#%_. The etiology of his prior lung disease at this time is suspected to be secondary to DIP. Since his last hospital admission on _%#MMDD2007#%_, he was started on 30 mg twice a day of prednisone for recurrence of DIP in his transplanted lung."
289,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"She has pain in her hands, but otherwise no joint pain to speak of. The pain in the hands is mostly stiffness in the proximal interphalangeal joints and DIP joints. She has had no diplopia, amaurosis fugax, localizing weakness, incoordination or dysphagia. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This is a pleasant lady whose mucous membranes are moist, but less than normal."
290,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"VITAL SIGNS: His blood pressure was 119/53, heart rate 79, respirations 24, temperature 97.7. RIGHT HAND: Complete avulsion and degloving of the distal tip of his right ring finger distal to the DIP joint. The soft tissue cap was being held on just by a thin skin bridge but circumferentially the vessels and soft tissue were degloved down to the bone dorsally and the flexor tendon volarly."
291,DIP,distal interphalangeal,EXTREMITIES: Examination of his left ring finger reveals a soft tissue defect from the area where the skin meets the nail/lunula and then carried back over the DIP joint. He is able to actively extend the finger as a portion of the extensor mechanism is still intact. He has good motion in his PIP and MP joint.
292,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Insight and judgment are poor but intact. Examination of the right hand: No swelling, erythema, symmetric with left hand. There is a plantar/flat wart on the right middle finger. The right ring finger is tender to palpation most at the DIP and PIP. Range of motion is about 10 percent flexion secondary to pain lacking 90 percent of the flexion. Extension is normal. Medial and lateral movement of the finger is normal."
293,DIP,distal interphalangeal,She has been on three different antibiotic trials without improvement. She has continued to develop increasing swelling and stiffness at the DIP joint level. She has had x-rays done which do not show any abnormalities such as osteomyelitis or joint erosions.
294,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Exam is significantly limited by the diminished range of motion and severe pain. There is also focal pain with palpation over the left fourth DIP joint and the right fourth MCP joint. No nodes, swelling or bony hypertrophy is appreciated in the hand joints. LABORATORY: Admission laboratory, white blood cell count 14.9 with 77% neutrophils and 11% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 11.7 with MCV 90, platelets 334."
295,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"He denies diabetes or other chronic illnesses. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is alert and oriented and has an obvious injury to the index finger. Adjacent digits are unharmed. The right index finger demonstrates an amputation at the level of the DIP joint with disarticulation. The proximal wound demonstrates articular cartilage of the middle phalanx with some abrasion to the cartilage, but overall appears preserved."
296,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"VITAL SIGNS: Stable. Examination of the hand shows extensive damage to the sterile matrix with a proximal laceration to the DIP joint. The third digit has complex injury to the sterile matrix and the nail itself no apparent damage, although there is though the appearance of tissue missing from the sterile matrix on the ulnar aspect of the distal quadrant of the nail."
297,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Following this, the flaps of the ring finger which was amputated at the DIP joint level was then trimmed and fashioned to cover the defect. I did not rongeur the remaining bone at this time as it was at the DIP joint level. This was externally sutured with multiple Steri-Strips. Attention was then directed toward the little finger and the same procedure was performed with a debridement of the tissue and refashioning of the flaps to accommodate a closure."
298,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"No rebound tenderness or guarding. No appreciable organomegaly. No obvious masses. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing or cyanosis. She had sclerodactyly mainly distal to the DIP joints. No evidence of subungual erythema or capillary loops. Trace bilateral lower extremity edema. NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II through XII intact, appropriate with questions; sensation intact to light touch."
299,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"The patient is able to extend to MCP, PIP and DIP joints. The patient is able to flexion at the MCP and PIP joints but not able to flex at the DIP joint. This wound is fairly superficial, does not appear there is evidence for joint involvement. RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION: Hand x-rays, 2 views: There does not appear to be any acute fracture or subluxation."
300,C4,cervical (level) 4,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cord compression at the level of C4, C7, and T2 secondary to metastatic lesions in these vertebral bodies with fractures. 2. Metastatic breast cancer status post mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation."
301,C4,(complement) component 4,"This is consistent with chronic disease. PROBLEM #6: Rheumatology/Lupus. Prior to admission on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ patient had an ANA which was 8.6, a double-stranded DNA was 233, complement C4 was 13, and complement C3 was 86. On _%#MMDD#%_ an ANA was 7.1, complement C3 82, and complement C4 was 13. Cardiolipin antibody IgG was 6.2 and IgM was 7.8. PROBLEM #7: Endocrine."
302,C4,cervical (level) 4,"There has been evidently two different radiation oncologists, one treating him at the Humphrey Cancer Center here in _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ and one at Mayo, and they have somewhat disagreed about further treatment. It looks like he maybe has additional growth into the C4 C spine and then recent MRI showed that the tumor is growing into the base of the brain. One of his oncologists said he did not consider treating, but that the oncologist at Mayo thought that they should continue to treat."
303,C4,(complement) component 4,"He had taken three doses of Warfarin at the time that he developed this rash. Allergy was consulted and they did come to see the patient, they did recommended a serum C3, C4, CH50, C1Q, C1 esterase inhibitor functionality, and they also requested checking an alpha and beta tryptase, as well as a 24-hour urine PGD2 histamine."
304,C4,cervical (level) 4,"3. Chronic pain syndrome. 4. Recurrent UTIs with pseudomonas, neurogenic bladder and suprapubic catheter. 5. Status post spinal cord decompression and graft arthrodesis. 6. C4 through C6 autologous iliac crest graft with cervical plate. 7. History of substance abuse. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable condition with the above-listed diagnoses."
305,C4,(complement) component 4,"C-reactive protein 1.53. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially evaluated in the emergency department by the rheumatology service who recommended admission due to concerns for lupus flare, flare of hepatitis B, Fitz- Hugh-Curtis syndrome, abdominal abscess or, most likely, a lupus flare with serositis. Subsequent studies showed a low complement C3 at 40, low complement C4 of 9; the patient's hepatitis B status was confirmed. She underwent CT of the abdomen that showed a small amount of abdominal ascites and moderate pelvic ascites, questionable edema of the gastric wall, a stable hyperdensity in the right kidney, sclerosis of the femoral heads consistent with avascular necrosis which was stable, and cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema."
306,C4,(complement) component 4,"Differential was 59% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 17% monos, and 0% eosinophils. An antinuclear antibody drawn on the day prior to transfer was mildly elevated at 1.3. C3 was 146, and C4 was 30. Liver function tests were unremarkable. IMAGING: The ultrasound from Ridges Hospital showed kidneys above the normal limits of size for this age."
307,C4,(complement) component 4,"CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: Grossly intact. SKIN: No suspicious rash noted. PSYCHIATRIC: Mentation and affect normal. LABORATORY DATA: C1 esterase, C3, C4 all pending at this time. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Angioedema of the face. Patient received an epinephrine intramuscularly, Decadron intravenous and Benadryl intravenous and also Zantac."
308,C4,(complement) component 4,"Typically in SLE, this number will come up over time with adequate immunosuppression, but sometimes we have had to temporarily give them intravenous IG because they are so profoundly hypogammaglobulinemic and they are having infectious problems. 5. I would continue to periodically recheck C3, C4 and his ENA screen and recheck his ferritin (although systemic onset JRA seems unlikely). 6. Further evaluation of his heart (if not already done) including echocardiogram, looking for valvular lesions typical of lupus may be helpful."
309,C4,cervical (level) 4,"REQUESTING PHYSICIAN: Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_. REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Evaluate for rehabilitation needs. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 52-year-old gentleman with a history of questionable/possible myasthenia gravis and he has cervical spine stenosis at C3-C4 with cervical spondylosis, status post decompressive laminectomy at C2-C3 with pedicle screw fixation of C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 bilaterally and arthrodesis of the joints at C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5 and C5-C6 using autologous bone graft and DBX matrix done by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MMDD2007#%_."
310,C4,(complement) component 4,"6. Recent MSSA (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) staph right arm infection, treated with Vancomycin as an outpatient. Most recent level noted to be 50. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Await serologies and blood cultures including as noted complement C3 C4, cryoglobulins, hepatitis C. 2. Await renal ultrasound to rule out obstruction. Evaluate size and asymmetry which should be unremarkable in this setting."
311,C4,cervical (level) 4,"The falls have been increasing over the course of the last year. In _%#MM#%_ 2004 the patient underwent an L4-L5 laminectomy and a C4 through C5 fusion for cord compression with myelopathy at both levels. Since that time, the patient has been unable to work because his falls have increased in frequency."
312,C4,cervical (level) 4,"She has 5/5 strength throughout. IMAGING: A cervical spine MRI is reviewed, which does reveal a somewhat stenotic cervical spine, as well as a likely autofusion of C3 and 4. She does also have disk herniations from C4 through C7. Plain films of her cervical spine do reveal a likely autofusion of C3/4. No acute fracture or dislocation. ASSESSMENT: Likely, left carpal tunnel syndrome and right long digit trigger finger."
313,C4,cervical (level) 4,"A plain lateral C- spine film was obtained. This was initially cleared by the ED staff, but he continued to complain of neck pain. CT was done, which showed a C4 fracture involving the body and left lamina of C4. The patient is otherwise neurologically intact and only complains of neck pain. He denies any headache, nausea, vomiting, motor, or sensory changes."
314,C4,cervical (level) 4,ASSESSMENT: 1. Status post spinal fusion from the occiput to C4 for the treatment of nonunion of a previous fusion. The patient is hemodynamically stable perioperatively. 2. History of obstructive sleep apnea.
315,C4,fourth heart sound:S4,"Neck supple; no jugular venous distention; no thyromegaly. Lungs: Bilateral rales and rhonchi heard diffusely heard over both lungs fields. Heart: Both heart sounds are audible; no S2, C4; no murmurs or gallops. Abdomen: Slightly distended; no rebound tenderness; no guarding; no rigidity. Scars of old surgery are benign. Extremities: The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema left greater than right."
316,C4,cervical (level) 4,"NEUROLOGIC: There is a slight weakness of the right upper extremity, otherwise, unremarkable. Assessment and Plan: Metastatic spinal lesion with spinal compression at the level of C4 and T1-2 area likely due to metastatic lesion from her breast cancer until otherwise proven.

377,DC,discontinue,"4. Congestive heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, probably ischemic cardiomyopathy. 5. MRSA urinary tract infection. RECOMMENDATIONS: Spironolactone has already been discontinued. Would DC I.V. fluids. Limit his total fluids to less than 1200 cc daily. Follow up urine sodium and urine osmolality. If K continues in current range, probably okay to continue the ACE inhibitor."
378,DC,District of Columbia,"The patient also reports she has gained about 20 pounds over the past few months because she started feeling better. She does have a history of mild depression treated by a psychiatrist in _%#CITY#%_, _%#CITY#%_ two years ago. She does not remember the name of the psychiatrist at this point.

Will check a magnesium and would consider colonoscopy for possible decompression, though INR is currently 6."
381,DC,direct current,"She is hemodynamically stable at this time. PROBLEM #1: Cardiovascular. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with recent RVR. She is now normal sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion twice. Continue amiodarone, diltiazem and Coumadin. PROBLEM #2: Cardiovascular. No known coronary artery disease but has hypertension."
382,DC,direct current,"She subsequently came to the emergency room. In the emergency room, her blood pressure was a bit on the low side, and they recommended DC cardioversion. This frightened her, and just as they were getting ready to put her to sleep to do the DC cardioversion, she spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm before any significant treatment was given."
383,DC,discontinue,"At this time, feels ready to be discharged and I am in agreement with that. The patient will be discharged to home. Will DC her IV and DC her to home with her oral medicines.

385,DC,discharge,Mom felt that the patient's hands looked a little grayish-blue in color. The patient also had complaint of abdominal and leg pain since hospital DC nine days prior. Mom stated that it often keeps him awake at night and is not resolved by Tylenol. The patient also had one episode of diarrhea the day of admission.
386,DC,discontinue,"He noted marked improvement following the initiation of these antibiotics and aggressive trach cares. As a side effects, he developed mild diarrhea which should resolve post DC of IV imipenem. He is on Coumadin for his history of aortic valve replacement and secondary to disruption of normal colonic flora and vitamin K carboxylation and metabolism within the gut."
387,DC,discontinue,"Hyponatremia, probably secondary to dehydration. Patient seems to have a combination of things causing her hyponatremia. She has been continued on her regular Lasix and spironolactone which is known to cause hyponatremia. Will DC her spironolactone for the time being and cut down her Lasix to half at 40 b.i.d. Will try to obtain old records to make sure that she has had an evaluation for lower extremity edema and would suggest that she might just be discharged on Lasix and TED stockings as a combination of the two probably is too dehydrating for her as she does say she has had an ongoing problem with dry mouth and certainly if she gets in situations where she is not taking good p.o. like presently, she is going to be certainly at risk for hyponatremia and/or acute renal failure."
388,DC,discontinue,"ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Chest pain, unlikely acute coronary syndrome, most likely due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastritis with hiatal hernia.

The left foot demonstrates some moderate swelling and edema with erythema and induration along the foot at the level of the MP joint of the great toe extending to the IP of the great toe and to the mid metatarsal region along the great toe."
468,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"This causes pain. As a result she walks with her foot somewhat to the side. She sought medical attention, was diagnosed with right hallucis rigidus of the first MP joint. She is in for surgical correction. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of ruptured aortic aneurysm age 69."
469,MP,metabolic panel,No tenderness to palpation along the spinal column. LABORATORY: The MP was within normal limits except for an elevated glucose of 539. LFTs are within normal limits. Lipase was less than 10.
470,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"ABDOMEN: Abdomen is soft and nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Examination of the left hand reveals a 1.5 cm transverse laceration in line with the middle finger, just proximal to the MP joint. He has a 20 degree MP joint extensor lag. There is full flexion of the digit, however. Neurovascular exam is intact. IMPRESSION: Left III extensor tendon laceration, dorsal hand."
471,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"He denies any fever, chills, or sweats and otherwise has been feeling satisfactory. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On the left hand, there is an abrasion over the dorsum of his MP joint, index finger left hand. There is also an abrasion on the dorsum of the hand itself. There is generalized mild to moderate swelling and erythema on the dorsum of his hand."
472,MP,mercaptopurine,"The patient tolerated his initial chemotherapy quite well and also received prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate. Prior to discharge he was continuing to tolerate chemotherapy well and the plan was to discharge him and have him continue the chemotherapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine (MP), cytarabine and Cytoxan as an outpatient. The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ for prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate weekly and to follow up in my office on Monday to repeat laboratory tests and to resume chemotherapy."
473,MP,mercaptopurine,She will follow up probably with _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ this week and with me the following week. Will plan to start 6- MP at that time. Diet will be slowly increased. Activity as tolerated.
474,MP,mercaptopurine,"He does not smoke, he drinks alcohol occasionally, is followed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ Medical Center and Dr. _%#CITY#%_ Minnesota GI Clinic, _%#CITY#%_, Minnesota. MEDICATIONS: 1. Lisinopril 5 mg daily. 2. 6 MP I believe exact dose unknown. He thinks it is 50 mg a day. 3. Colestid 2 tablets b.i.d. 4. Sudafed p.r.n. takes this approximately daily. He took 2 tablets yesterday."
475,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"Apparently she was pulling a blanket from right to left while she was making her bed. She felt a ""pop"" in her hand and after that she immediately had trouble extending her long finger MP joint. This patient noted minimal swelling in the area and really only a mild amount of pain."
476,MP,metacarpophalangeal,He is very pleasant with his mother and answering questions appropriately. EXTREMITIES: Examination of his left upper extremity reveals a crescent-shaped laceration just distal to the MP joint of his left index finger. There is significant bleeding in this area. _%#NAME#%_ would not voluntarily extend the finger for me today.
477,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"Neurovascular status is intact. There is a complex 3 cm laceration with avulsion along the skin with some partial thickness and full thickness skin loss over the dorsal aspect of the MP joint. This communicates directly with the fracture. X-RAYS: Three views of the left hand were reviewed, which demonstrate a comminuted fracture of the metacarpal neck, the index finger with flexion deformity and shortening."
478,MP,mercaptopurine,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: HEENT is negative. Cardiorespiratory is negative. GI - see history of present illness. Last fall the patient had been on prednisone for approximately six to eight weeks. At that time 6- MP was started and the patient was subsequently stable. GU unremarkable. The patient has apparently missed her last one or two periods, but otherwise there has been no problems."
479,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"He has the Charcot changes on his plain films, along the spur off the shaft of the second metatarsal. He has a dislocated left second MP joint. He has, on MRI scan, soft tissue edema on the plantar surface. I am not as impressed by any osteomyelitic changes in the second metatarsal head, however."
480,MP,mercaptopurine,"At that time, she was prescribed cortisone, corticosteroids, and weaned successfully. According to old records, she has good compliance with her current 6- MP and Pentasa. Her last flexible sigmoidoscopy was in _%#MM#%_ 2004 which showed minimally active Crohn's disease. No flares since _%#MM#%_ 2003. 2. History of low albumin per Dr. _%#NAME#%_."
481,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"Two days ago and on _%#MMDD2004#%_, this patient was cutting up some vegetables at home, holding the knife in her dominant right hand. Unfortunately, the knife slipped and she essentially stabbed the medial aspect of her left index finger near the MP joint. This patient did not seek medical treatment. Over the course of the last two days, she has noted increasing pain and swelling in the joint and difficulty moving her finger."
482,MP,mercaptopurine,"The 6-MP was then discontinued shortly secondary to concerns about adverse effects on the liver. The patient was maintained on prednisone 40 mg p.o. daily, and then on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, the 6- MP was resumed at a lower dose, 50 mg per day, as the patient had previously been on 75 mg Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, and 50 mg Monday, Wednesday, Friday."
483,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient has a violaceous appearing ring finger. The erythema demarcates quite significantly just proximal to the MP joint, both dorsally and volarly. The patient has no evidence of flexor tendon signs, with full range of motion of the digit and no digital swelling."
484,MP,mercaptopurine,"She has required steroids twice to help increase her hemoglobin and has been receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with Coumadin prior to her admission. She is being treated under study UMN BMT 2001-10 which includes reduced intensity conditioning chemotherapy with Cytoxan, fludarabine, ATG, MP, and total body irradiation. Further details can be found in the history and physical form detailed in her chart. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Fluids, Electrolytes, and Nutrition. After starting chemotherapy _%#NAME#%_ rapidly lost her appetite and was placed on TPN on _%#MMDD2005#%_."
485,MP,metabolic panel,"He will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ at Fairview Milaca Clinic in one week. He is to follow up in Transplant Clinic with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in two weeks. Follow-up laboratories: Hemoglobin A1C, ANC, MP, magnesium, CBC with platelets in 1-2 weeks. The patient's surgical wound is to be kept clean and dry. Accu-Cheks q.i.d. with coverage of Regular insulin with sliding scale."
486,MP,mercaptopurine,"LABORATORY: White count 2.0, hemoglobin 11.4, platelets of 86. Chem panel significant for creatinine of 0.95. SPEP showed a beta 2 peak of 6.0. Total protein was 7.3. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Bone marrow transplant: The patient was started on protocol MT _%#PROTOCOL#%_ with preparation including Cytoxan, fludarabine, ATG, and MP. He also received one dose of total body radiation. Transplantation was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005 with HLA matched allogeneic sibling donor which was actually the cousins with a 6/6 match."
487,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"He was given some Keflex but, unfortunately, this caused a rash. He was therefore readmitted. An aspirate of this patient's hand (presumably the MP joints) revealed MRSA. He has been admitted to this hospital under the care of Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, who has recommended that I see the patient."
488,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"When this patient was two years old, he apparently grabbed a hot curling iron and sustained a rather severe burn to his left palm. As such, he developed some palmar scar tissue which eventually resulted in some contracture of his central three MP joints. This has caused some functional problem for him and he therefore presents for surgical release. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : This patient is quite healthy. He has no medical problems."
489,MP,metacarpophalangeal,EXTREMITIES: Examination of his left upper extremity being compared with right upper extremity reveals an oblique laceration on the index finger between the MP and PIP crease. He has full profundus and superficialis pull-through. He has diminished 2 point discrimination which is greater than a centimeter on the radial side and 3-4 mm on the ulnar side.
490,MP,mercaptopurine,"She was able to be discharged on _%#MMDD2003#%_. DISCHARGE PLANS: The patient is discharged on _%#MMDD2003#%_ with Remicade, per protocol, after 2 weeks and 6 weeks, prednisone tapering (schedule provided by Dr. _%#NAME#%_), Asacol (400 mg tabs) 4 tabs t.i.d., 6- MP 50 mg q.a.m., with CBC in two weeks, and follow up per Minnesota Gastroenterology in one month's time."
491,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,Motor exam reveals normal painless function at the NP joint with some decreased flexion at the PIP joint and markedly decreased flexion at the DIP joint. The patient does have full extension at the MP joint but is unable to fully extend at either the PIP or DIP joint. Both flexion and extension of the finger appear to be painless.
492,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"5. Hypercholesterolemia. 6. Prostatic hypertrophy. PROCEDURES: Spinal canal exploration and drainage of abscess as well as surgical drainage of pyogenic arthritis and tenosynovitis, right hand. HISTORY: This gentleman had gradual onset of increasing low back pain and shortly before hospitalization, some weakness in his legs along with redness and swelling of the right thumb at the MP joint and then spreading into more diffuse inflammation and swelling on the dorsum of the hand. MRI scan done of the low back demonstrated epidural abscess in the lumbar region."
493,MP,metacarpophalangeal,Examination of his left upper extremity revealed a laceration proximal to the IP joint of the thumb and distal to the MP joint. He was unable to fully extend the thumb at the IP joint. Extensor pollicis longus tendon has retracted. His APL and EPB are intact.
494,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"She essentially has a bunion of her right first MP joint, which has not caused particular alarm, though is obviously enlarged visibly. She also has bunions on her left feet, but the first MP joint and the fifth MP joint. At this particular time, the bunion deformity causing the most deformity is the outer aspect of her left foot, that is her fifth metatarsophalangeal joint."
495,MP,metatarsophalangeal,"There was nodularity and scarring. The foot in general was quite swollen and deformed. In addition, there was a 5 x 5 mm ulceration on the plantar surface of the left foot at the MP joint of the third toe. ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: Admission labs were remarkable for: White count 10.3. Hemoglobin 7.5. Platelets 501."
496,MP,mercaptopurine,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ulcerative colitis diagnosed in summer of 2002. She is seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. She had been on 6 MP, Pentasa, and Colestid.

760,RA,right atrium,"Chest x-ray is a portable film, somewhat poor quality, not full inspiration. There is most likely vascular redistribution. There is slight prominence of the RA in the ascending aorta, but it is probably because it is a rotated film. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated compared to the left. IMPRESSION: This is a patient who is having a large inferoapical and probably right ventricular infarct as demonstrated by elevated neck veins and ST elevation in V1 greater than V2."
761,RA,right atrium,Stool was positive for vancomycin resistant enterococcus.

799,RA,right atrium,"The reason for the transesophageal echocardiogram was an attempt to delineate her VSD anatomy more precisely as in the past the question of diagnosis of Valsalva aneurysm, and aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva communicating to the atrium was raised. On another occasion, she was diagnosed left ventricular to RA shunt. However, the VSD and preceding DDE seemed to have corresponded to classical membranous VSD defect of a 3 mm in size with mild to moderate left to right shunt and no right to left shunt."
800,T2,thoracic (level) 2,NEUROLOGIC: Upper extremity strength is symmetric and intact. Lower extremity strength is a 2/4. IMPRESSION: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 47-year-old male with likely renal cell carcinoma metastatic to T2 vertebral body. PLAN: We discussed the option of palliative radiation to his T2 vertebral lesion.
801,T2,tumor stage 2,IMPRESSION: Probable low rectal cancer. A CT scan today was also negative and chest x-ray is negative for metastases. This does appear to be clinically a T2 or T3 lesion. I believe I would start the workup at this point with a colonoscopy to evaluate the rest of the colon.
802,T2,tumor stage 2,"ADDENDUM: After further review of available oncology records from _%#MM2005#%_, it has become apparent that _%#NAME#%_ was appropriately treated with initially Arimidex (this was poorly tolerated) and later tamoxifen. Her disease was in fact stage I (T2, N0, M0) ER-positive infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast, as described above. It appears that she may have been lost to oncologic followup, as the last available note is from _%#MM#%_ 2005."
803,T2,T2 (MRI),"Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care and evaluation of this very interesting, pleasant gentleman. ADDENDUM: I have just received a preliminary report on the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. There was a nonspecific T2 signal described on the right side of the cervical spine at the C3-C4 level. The possibility of a demyelinating disorder was raised. Interestingly, the thoracic cord did not reveal any abnormalities as identified by the preliminary report."
804,T2,tumor stage 2,"A biopsy of the left mainstem bronchus mass, _%#MMDD2005#%_, showed non-small-cell carcinoma, which did not appear to be adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. A PET scan in _%#MM#%_ 2005 showed increased uptake in the left hilum only, and the patient was staged as IB (T2 N0). She was not felt to be a surgical candidate due to her age and poor pulmonary status. She has severe COPD, and the location of the tumor would have required a pneumonectomy."
805,T2,T2 (MRI),"2. Atrial fibrillation. 3. Palindromic rheumatism. OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left lower extremity Doppler on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, occlusive deep venous thrombosis of left popliteal and distal left superficial femoral vein just above the knee. 2. MRI of the brain. No evidence of atrioventricular malformation. 3. Nonspecific foci of T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter likely related to minimal small vessel ischemic disease. 4. Right lower extremity Doppler. No evidence for deep venous thrombosis."
806,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, to the surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was undertaken which showed again a large mass at the level of T2 extending into the spinal canal with compression of the thecal sac on the right. This MRI also showed a large heterogenous mass in the right kidney which was concerning for renal cell carcinoma."
807,T2,T2 (MRI),"3. _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, the patient received a PIC line without any complications. 4. _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, the patient had an MRI of the brain with and without contrast. Impression: A. Nonspecific changes of T2 hyperintensity within the deep white matter of the centrum semiovale and periventricular region bilaterally consistent with small vessel ischemic disease."
808,T2,T2 (MRI),"She had an MRI of the brain which demonstrates isointense mass in the left posterior superior temporal lobe. It is isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2, brightly enhancing gadolinium what appears to be dural based lesion. Looks like there is preservation of underlying neuro-structures that are consistent with meningioma."
809,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"The patient had repeated MRI on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which again showed multiple metastatic area, especially in the area of the pain at T1, T2, T4 and T6. She has a mild bulging posteriorly at the level of T4, which is probably due to compression fracture."
810,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"4. History of recent rollover motor vehicle accident on _%#MMDD#%_, status post exploratory laparotomy and 1-week hospitalization at HCMC. The patient was found to have duodenal hematoma too small to evacuate, left suboccipital condyle fracture, and a T2 spinous process fracture. The patient currently on Percocet for pain. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Exploratory laparotomy approximately 1 week ago (as above)."
811,T2,T2 (MRI),"1. Chest x-ray showed stable bibasilar density, left greater than right, most likely represents atelectasis. 2. MRI/MRA of the brain showed no change in previously described T2 hyperintensities involving left optic radiation, right cerebellar hemisphere, and periventricular white matter. Also, attenuation of M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery."
812,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Multiple brain metastases with known metastatic, systemic primary tumor. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old right-handed female with a history of known tonsillar adenoma with metastases to the T2 vertebral body, status post corpectomy with cage and pedicle screw fixation from T1 to T3 by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ in _%#MM2006#%_. She did well postoperatively and was last seen by Neurosurgery in _%#MM2006#%_ with a complication of a postoperative seroma and epidural extension with mild spinal cord compression causing urinary retention, also status post wound washout for that situation."
813,T2,T2 (MRI),The MRI noted extensive white matter T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity within the posterior half of both cerebral hemispheres and involving the posterior third of the corpus callosum. The corticospinal tracts bilaterally are also involved through the brain stem. There was a focus of T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity involving the middle cerebral peduncle on the right. All of these findings are unchanged compared to the earlier examination.
814,T2,T2 (MRI),DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Seizure disorder. IMAGING DONE DURIING HOSPITALIZATION: 1. MRI of the head done _%#MMDD2004#%_: (A) Unchanged areas of T2 hyperintensity with decrease in the T2 hyperintensity within the left parietal occipital cortical region. Post biopsy changes with no new areas of contrast enhancement over the left frontal lobe convexity.
815,T2,tumor stage 2,HOSPITAL COURSE: Chemotherapy induction for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The patient was admitted for induction chemotherapy of his T2 N2c mildly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of his head and neck on _%#MMDD2006#%_. The patient was started on cisplatin and docetaxel for the first day and also was started on a 5-FU continuous pump throughout his hospitalization.
816,T2,T2 (MRI),"HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. The patient was admitted to Neurology Service on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, head CT obtained that evening showed small-vessel ischemic disease of the white matter, right parietal encephalomalacia, no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, high-grade frontal calcified meningiomas overlying hyperostosis. An MRI of the brain was obtained subsequent day on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, that showed deep white matter infarctions in the left frontoparietal region, extensive foci of T2 hyperintensity and the periventricular white matter consistent with severe small-vessel ischemic disease, 18-mm extraaxial enhancing right parietal mass consistent with meningioma, severe narrowing of the distal right common carotid artery, proximal right internal carotid artery, irregularity of the middle cerebral arteries and posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally consistent with atherosclerotic disease."
817,T2,T2 (MRI),"3. MRI subsequently done 11:30 a.m. on _%#MMDD2007#%_ shows small acute parenchymal hematoma with symmetric hyperintensities in the occipital, parietal and posterior frontal region, which is most likely PRES/posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. There is also several hyperintensities in the T2 images periventricularly, which is probably small-vessel ischemic disease. There does not appear to be any evidence of any tumor. LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 133 and it has been trending down as it was in the 140s a few days ago."
818,T2,T2 (MRI),"Impression: 1. A 3.2 by 4.0 by 6.0 cm mass, dorsal to olecranon. Appearance consistent with hemorrhagic bursitis versus hematoma. 2. Diffuse increased T2 signal in subcutaneous tissue of the volar aspect of the forearm, demonstrating minimal enhancement, likely representing cellulitis."
819,T2,T2 (MRI),MRI of the pelvis showed a 3.5 x 1.7 x 3.2 cm destructive mass within the right superior pubic ramus and acetabulum. Marked amount of increased T2 signal within the adductor muscle. The proximal right thigh and right obturator internus may represent denervation edema and right hip synovitis inflammatory versus reactive.
820,T2,tumor stage 2,"PROBLEM: Stage IIB, T2, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left neck with extracapsular extension and with subglottic extension of the glottic larynx, status post 7440 cGy to the larynx in 120 b.i.d treatments between the dates of _%#MMDD2002#%_ and _%#MMDD2002#%_, status post recent neck dissection (please see initial consultation from _%#MMDD2002#%_ and last clinic note from _%#MMDD2003#%_). HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ initially presented to us in _%#MM2002#%_ with a T2, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the true glottic larynx with subglottic extension of approximately 1 cm."
821,T2,tumor stage 2,"She eventually had a biopsy done which was consistent with a nonsmall cell carcinoma of the lung, after the immunostaining was done, it was adenocarcinoma. Her diagnosis was T2, N3, M0. She was given concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The chemotherapy used was Carboplatin along with Taxol. She finished that concurrent treatment and came to _%#CITY#%_ where she was seen at Hubert H. Humphrey Cancer Center and was given two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Taxol which she finished on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_."
822,T2,T2 (MRI),"_%#NAME#%_ was last administered gammaglobulin on _%#MMDD2007#%_. _%#NAME#%_ has undergone Port-A-Cath placement. _%#NAME#%_ had a cranial MRI obtained on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which showed a small, abnormal enhancing focus with surrounding high T2 signal within the subcortical white matter of the right parietal lobe, near the vertex. There were 3 other tiny foci of high T2 signal within the subcortical and deep white matter."
823,T2,T2 (MRI),"Sensation is intact to light touch. She is diffusely hyperreflexic with upgoing toes bilaterally. Sustained clonus in bilateral ankles. MRI of the brain was available for review revealing stenosis at the cervicomedullary junction, abnormal sella turcica, pineal cystic lesion, and periventricular T2 hyperintensity. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 13-year-old girl with a history of multiple sulfatase deficiency, tracheostomy dependency, cervicomedullary junction stenosis, and myelopathy."
824,T2,T2 (MRI),"There is no salient history of abnormality in the pregnancy or delivery. On initial inspection, cerebral imaging seemed unremarkable. Subsequently, there was an interpretation of the cranial MRI reporting an area of ill-defined T2 hyperintensity with corresponding restricted diffusion within the bilateral posterior limbs of the internal capsules, putamen and anterior and lateral anterior thalami."
825,T2,tumor stage 2,"There was some thickening below both of those scars. There was no other masses, nipple discharge, edema or erythema noted. IMPRESSION: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 46-year old with a T2, N1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, status post lumpectomy, followed by full axillary dissection. Status post four cycles of AC chemotherapy. The patient is currently in her second cycle of Taxol of a planned four cycles."
826,T2,tumor stage 2,"PROBLEM: T2 N2B MO squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of mouth, status post resection with partial mandibulectomy and left modified neck dissection. The patient was seen in consultation by _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_."
827,T2,tumor stage 2,"On the _%#DD#%_, patient had been tolerating regular diet, was voiding without Foley, and was using only p.o. pain medication. The path report, which came back on the _%#DD#%_, showed proximal large polyp with invasive adenocarcinoma T2, as well as a distal large polyp with intramucosal adenocarcinoma, which was T0. All of the 16 lymph node samples were negative. Therefore, it was determined stage 1 proximal retrosigmoid carcinoma."
828,T2,T2 (MRI),PROCEDURES: 1. MRI obtained on _%#MMDD2007#%_ demonstrated T2 hyperintensity in the mostly subcortical white matter of the posterior frontal lobes of the brain. There was no evidence of acute infarction and no enhancement of the T2 hyperintensity. 2. Dialysis per patient's schedule. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Please see admission history and physical for complete details.
829,T2,T2 (MRI),She has had retrograde amnesia from this to some extent. A head MRI done at the time of admission showed a 1.5 cm. area of mixed increased and decreased T2 signal in the left anterior frontal region consistent with hemorrhagic contusion which was also see on her head CT. Also noted was irregularity over a 4 cm. region in the posterior temporal region consistent with hemorrhagic contusion.
830,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"The patient's MRI of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were repeated after admission, and it was determined to have signal abnormality of the C4 to the T4 cord levels. Examination was significant for a decreased sensation below the T2 dermatomal level with flaccid tone in her lower extremities, with no movement in the left lower extremity and right lower extremity, being antigravity proprioception preserved in the left lower extremity but not present in the right."
831,T2,T2 (MRI),"OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, the patient had an MRI of the brain which yielded the following results: 1. Focus of restricted diffusion with increased T2 signal, and mild enhancement in theleft corticospinal tract. This may represent a subacute phase of an injury to the corticospinal tract such as infarct versus intramyelinic edema possibly due to graft-versus-host disease versus much less likely lymphoma."

833,T2,tumor stage 2,"HEART: Regular sinus rhythm. ABDOMEN: Unremarkable. EXTREMITIES: Unremarkable. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, status post lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy, Stage T2 M0 N0. The patient is going to be on tamoxifen. The patient is recommended post-lumpectomy radiation treatment."
834,T2,thoracic (level) 2,"Postoperatively, he has been unable to move his lower extremities and his upper extremities are weak. Apparently he has some biceps contraction and triceps function. Postop MRI recently showed increased T2 signal from C2 through T2 level and cord swelling from C4 through C6. The patient is currently still intubated. The plans include in the immediate future the patient will be receive a tracheotomy."
835,T2,T2 (MRI),"Lumbar puncture and other neurologic workups were at that time described as negative. There was slight elevation of CSF protein with unclear significance. A brain MRI of _%#MMDD2007#%_ revealed diffusely increased T2 signal intensity of the cerebral white matter, most prominent within the periatrial regions, the splenium of the corpus callosum and the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes, but also within the posterior and midfrontal paraventricular and subcortical regions."
836,T2,tumor stage 2,"No subglottic disease can be visualized. The piriform sinuses both appear normal and have no pooling or masses. IMPRESSION: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right neck levels 2/3, with extracapsular extension and poorly differentiated, now almost six months status post completion of radiation therapy to T2, N0, M0 moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the subglottic larynx, now status post neck dissection. PLAN: This is an unusual case. It is highly unlikely that T2 larynx cancer would metastasize to neck nodes, with reported incidence being 5%, yet the time frame is correct."
837,T2,tumor stage 2,"_____ Patient examined by resident/fellow in my presence. Discussed with resident and agree with note. My key findings: CC: Base of tongue T2 NoMo, post-op with close margin (1mm). HPI: Had difficulty swallowing and speaking and was found to have squamous cell CA."
838,T2,T2 (MRI),This showed a large mass measuring 16 cm x 12 cm x 11 cm in size and was hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images. No extracapsular invasion was seen. A differential diagnosis based on the imaging available was focal nodular hyperplasia versus fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma.
839,T2,tumor stage 2,"FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of left lower lobe lung with metastases to one peribronchial lymph node, pathological stage T2 N1 M0. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Other diagnoses: 1. Post-obstructive pneumonectomy consolidation, left lower lobe lung."
840,T2,T2 (MRI),"2. MRI of the brain with and without contrast, which revealed the presence of a rounded sharply defined mass that appears to be dural based on the right posterior frontal convexity with invagination into the underlying cortex. The lesion was centrally hypointense on T1 weighted imaging and hypertensive on T2 weighted imaging. On T2 gradient echo imaging, there was a central isointensity with peripheral irregular hypointensity consistent with calcification or hemorrhage following intravenous gadolinium this peripheral contrast enhancement around the margin of this lesion was measured 11 mm x 10 mm x 0.9 mm based on the MR characteristics that the lesion was most likely representing meningioma with calcific rim."
841,T2,T2 (MRI),"PROBLEM #4: MRA findings of avascular necrosis. The patient had an MRA performed during the hospital course to evaluate for any renal artery stenosis contributing to her hypertensive crisis. That MRA did show evidence of possible increased T2 signal in femoral heads, which was possibly related to marrow re-conversion versus avascular necrosis. This will be followed up as an outpatient with the primary care physician."
842,T2,T2 (MRI),"5. History of hypercalcemia. 6. Chronic malnutrition. PROCEDURES: 1. CT of the head (_%#MMDD2005#%_): Interpretation limited by significant motion artifact. No interval change. 2. MRI of the brain with and without contrast (_%#MMDD2005#%_): This study demonstrated greater than 10 foci of T2 hyperintensity within the cerebral white matter, consistent with a clinical suspicion of demyelinating _________ disease. Post contrast images are degraded by significant motion artifact. There is progression of disease as compared with a prior study."
843,T2,T2 (MRI),"2. MRI of L-spine with and without contrast on _%#MMDD2007#%_ reveals broadbased disc bulging at L4-5 level causing mild spinal canal bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and no abnormal signal or contrast enhancement in the cord. 3.

At the time of discharge, the patient was awake, alert and oriented and had no new neurological complaints or deficits."
992,IA,(class) IA,"Our choices generally would be Sotalol or amiodarone since she apparently has left ventricular dysfunction. I would be unlikely to use a type IA medication with her. If she develops significant bradycardia with this approach, a permanent pacemaker would be necessary. I would avoid amiodarone for now given her COPD. She does not show evidence of congestive heart failure at this time."
993,IA,intraarterial,"The patient at that time had improving language, although weakness remained. Given the patient's fluctuating symptoms Dr. _%#NAME#%_ our neural interventionalist recommended giving intravenous TPA and then proceeding with a CT angio and CT perfusion scan of the brain to evaluate the need for IA TPA. Initial head CT on _%#MMDD#%_ revealed the following: No acute hemorrhage, moderate small vessel ischemic disease, lacunar infarcts in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule and in the heads of both caudate nuclei, old left cerebellar infarct."
994,IA,(stage) IA,"The surgery went well and had no complications. There is to be returned to the recovery room in stable condition.

She had a procedure done at CDI which appears to have been an attempted sciatic nerve block. The Band-Aid is about 8 cm from the midline in the left buttock area."
1352,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,The patient indicated an understanding of these potential risks and a willingness to proceed with treatment. Written signed consent was obtained. 3. The patient will be undergoing imaging studies at CDI on Thursday. We have obtained release of information signed by the patient so as to allow us access to the results. We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the evaluation and care of this most interesting young man.
1353,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Emotional, Social and Behavioral Functioning: _%#NAME#%_'s emotional, social, and behavioral functioning was assessed using several self-report measures, projective measures, and a clinical interview. Results from the CDI reflected an overall score within the ""at-risk"" range (T = 64). These results suggest that _%#NAME#%_ endorsed a higher number of items associated with depression than the majority of boys his age."
1354,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"He also has difficulty responding to school-based items. His CDI resulted in clinically significant levels for interpersonal problems. Items of interest, include ""many bad things are my fault."" ""I get into fights many times."" ""I do not do what I am told most times.""

PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING: _%#NAME#%_'s psychological functioning was assessed using self-report scales (CDI, RCMAS), a sentence completion test (SCT) and a projective measure (RATC). _%#NAME#%_ completed the CDI, which is a self-rating scale designed to assess for symptoms of depression in young people."
1358,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"_%#NAME#%_'s emotional, social, and behavioral functioning were assessed with self-report measures (CDI and RCMAS), Projective Measures (RATC) and sentence completion and a clinical interview. Results of interviews with _%#NAME#%_'s father and EBD teacher were also helpful in this process. Results from the CDI reflected a number of symptoms of depression, with _%#NAME#%_'s total score within the borderline range (T=68). _%#NAME#%_ also obtained significant elevations on subscales indexing negative mood (T=70), and anhedonia (T=75)."
1359,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"Her right shoulder symptoms recurred over the last few months. 2. In _%#MM2006#%_ she had an MRI of the shoulder at CDI showing moderate sized 50-80% partial thickness articular surface tear of the distal supraspinatus tendon without muscular atrophy. Also, moderate infraspinatus and subscapularis tendinosis with distal articular surface degeneration and fraying but no discrete tear."
1360,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"She does have a negative Homans, but diffuse edema distally. The neurovascular status is intact. Her hip has good range of motion.

1362,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"_%#NAME#%_'s other difficulties with anxiety, depression, and symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder also make a diagnosis of ADHD difficult at this time, as these disorders often tend to interfere with concentration skills and motivation in particular areas. _%#NAME#%_ also completed several self-report measures, entitled the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RSMAS). Results from the CDI reflected a significant elevation on a subscale indexing symptoms of negative self-esteem (T=70)."
1363,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,Her husband points out that she has had several episodes of hallucination after operations and most recently after the stress test at CDI. She was subsequently seen and had a CT scan and lab testing at Southdale Emergency Room. I think all of this underscores the fact that this procedure is high risk.
1364,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"About a month ago she developed abdominal pain and was seen at the Fairview _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ clinic. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done at that time at CDI. She states that she was told she had ""colitis"" and was treated with a course of antibiotics. She was actually scheduled for a colonoscopy at our _%#CITY#%_ center tomorrow to further investigate this."
1365,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Results suggest that _%#NAME#%_ endorsed a higher than typical level of symptoms of depression in comparison to other females her age. Results from the CDI also reflected a clinically significant elevation on subscale indexing interpersonal problems and negative self-esteem. Result from the (RCMAS), which is the self-report measure designed to assess for symptoms of anxiety in children, also reflected in overall score within the borderline ""at risk"" range."
1366,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,He tolerated a regular diet. At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile and his vital signs were within normal limits including his blood sugars. The patient has an incredibly supportive home environment at CDI Home who have come to visit him regularly during this hospitalization and are eager to have him return to their care upon discharge.
1367,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Throughout testing, _%#NAME#%_'s frustration level increased significantly on tasks that were more difficult for him, such as this one. Results from the clinical interview with _%#NAME#%_ were consistent with results from the CDI, RCMAS, and projective measures. During the interview _%#NAME#%_ described feeling sad about not having friends."
1368,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,She states that the pain is not like that which she had previously with pancreatitis. The patient also states that she had an adenosine thallium done at CDI Center for diagnostic imaging on _%#STREET#%_ _%#STREET#%_ in _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_. CDI was contacted and the patient did have an adenosine thallium that was performed on _%#MMDD2005#%_ and it was a negative study.
1369,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"During this hospitalization, I plan to workup these conditions by performing the follow: 1. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (with comparison to his outside CT scan from CDI on _%#MMDD2004#%_). 2. Diuresis with IV Lasix. 3. Close monitoring of his electrolyte levels given the planned diuresis. 4. Possible MRI of brain to compare to previous outside scan."

1371,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"They also seem to have immature relationships with others. Conversely, they usually do accurately perceive the actions of others and tend to understand the consequences of their own actions. CDI resulted in no clinically significant level for any of the depressive scales. Items of interest include ""I think about killing myself but I would not do it."" The RCMAS also did not result in any clinically significant level for anxiety symptoms."
1372,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"He obtained an overall score within the low average, mildly delayed range (SS=85, 16th percentile), consistent with an age equivalent of a 9-year-old child.

1701,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,Otherwise no areas of other abnormality or pain detected. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 60-year-old female with multiple myeloma status post four cycles of VAD chemotherapy who is now being considered for autologous stem-cell transplant per protocol _%#PROTOCOL#%_. This protocol includes Cytoxan x2 followed by 3 days of total body irradiation 165 cGy b.i.d. 6990 cGy.
1702,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"LDH and liver function tests were within normal limits. The patient underwent four cycles of VAD chemotherapy with an approximately 40% decrease in the size of her liver lesion and a 50% decrease in her monoclonal spike. Her T12 lesion has been stable. After completion of VAD, the patient was placed on thalidomide, which she currently remains on. Her most recent CT of the abdomen and pelvis _%#MMDD2005#%_ shows a slight interval decrease in the mass in her liver."
1703,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"At that time she had 25% to 30% plasma cells in her initial marrow including complex cytogenetics. She also had lytic lesions. She was treated with several cycles of VAD, which yielded a good partial response. The plan was to proceed promptly to transplant. However, due to insurance issues, her treatment was postponed."
1704,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"Skeletal survey revealed compression fractures, osteopenia of left humerus and pelvis and small lucency of the skull. His calcium was 7.6, hemoglobin 10.9, he had a normal creatinine. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ received five cycles of VAD chemotherapy ending in _%#MM2003#%_. He was re-staged after his fourth cycle and M-spike decreased to 1.3. He had follow-up bone marrow biopsy in _%#CITY#%_, details not available."
1705,VAD,ventricular assist device,"This has led to a sense of needing to vomit and vomiting, and ungulates, but does occur with any type of eating. Radiographic evaluation here has shown that he has a left diaphragmatic hernia which is related to the previous hole in the diaphragm for the VAD procedure. I spent a total of 45 minutes in counseling and coordination and care reviewing his history and his radiographic evaluations."
1706,VAD,ventricular assist device,"We plan to continue with Bumex today. 3. Neurological: The patient remains intubated and sedated and at least for the next 24 hours we do not plan to assess his neurological function. 4. Hepatic: His liver enzymes are resolving, which is suggestive of hepatic recovery. 5. Hematological: Because of excellent VAD flows, we will hold heparin for another 24 hours. We will check ACT and if it is less than 160, we will start him on low dose heparin."
1707,VAD,ventricular assist device,She underwent immediate intubation in preparation for OR. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 61-year-old woman status post HeartMate L- VAD now with hemothorax following a left thoracentesis with continued hemodynamic instability. We plan urgent thoracotomy and exploration. I will ask for an intraoperative evaluation/consultation from the Thoracic Surgery Service by Dr. _%#NAME#%_.
1708,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,MRI was reviewed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ who felt it was reasonable for her to discharge from the hospital. No surgical intervention was done during the hospitalization. Chemotherapy with VAD was administered without significant complications.
1709,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"She became anuric after her code and she had some respiratory failure, was intubated, and is currently on the ventilator. Prior to her code, she had been discussing with her cardiologist, Dr. _%#NAME#%_, whether or not she would want VAD as she was not a transplant candidate. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10-1% and inotrope-dependent."
1710,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,4. Renal insufficiency. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 50-year-old female with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. She was diagnosed in _%#MM2002#%_ when she presented with left rib and shoulder pain. She was treated with VAD for 4 cycles with minimal response. This VAD was followed by high dose Cytoxan which resulted in complete remission.
1711,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,She has since been treated with dexamethasone alone followed by thalidomide and dexamethasone combination and was recently switched to Velcade after progressive disease. After moving to the _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ she established care with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ and received her first dose of VAD as above in _%#MM#%_ of 2005. 2. Anemia related to her multiple myeloma for which she is on both Procrit and blood transfusion support.
1712,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"3. Multiple myeloma with clear-cut evidence of progression of disease, onset Cytoxan and prednisone. She is not a candidate for the VAD regimen based on problems with recurrent hyperglycemia as well as underlying heart disease. An alternative to this would be thalidomide. We discussed the side effects as well as benefits of thalidomide and will set in motion the registration process to obtain this."
1713,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"Therefore Dr. _%#NAME#%_ recommended additional VAD chemotherapy. Since that time Mr. _%#NAME#%_ indicates he received one addition cycle of VAD chemotherapy in _%#MM#%_, 2002. He has never received radiation treatments. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ has no siblings. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ presents to our clinic today at the request of Dr. _%#NAME#%_ consideration of the autologous transplant, and to discuss radiation conditioning."
1714,VAD,UNSURED SENSE,"The patient had a lot of low back pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Multiple myeloma, diagnosed in 1995. Extensive disease of the lumbar spine and back pain. Status post VAD at that time with continued back pain. In _%#MM1996#%_ the patient went for an autologous bone marrow transplant. The patient received 990 rads in six fractions between _%#MMDD1996#%_ and _%#MMDD1996#%_."
1715,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"After two cycles, he was referred to the Fairview-University Medical Center where he saw Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MMDD2002#%_. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ agreed with the plan for the additional VAD, followed by an allogeneic peripheral blood stem-cell transplant with a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. As mentioned, the chemotherapy ended in _%#MM#%_. He was able to stop taking the narcotics for the pain control, therefore, his pain was resolved."
1716,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"4. Mucositis. 5. Neutropenic fevers. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 46-year-old female with IgA multiple myeloma diagnosed in _%#MM#%_ 2001 with an IgA spike of 2.7, 5% plasma cells, kappa light chain restricted, normal creatinine and no bone lesions. That is Stage 1A disease. The patient was treated with four cycles of VAD with good response with a decrease in the IgA spike to 1.2 and 2% plasma cells in the bone marrow. The patient's pretransplant workup showed a normal SPEP with normal clonal spike in _%#MM#%_ 2002 and 5% atypical plasma cells in the bone marrow."
1717,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"The patient was subsequently found to have plasmacytoma in the left iliac region. This was needle biopsied, and shown to be 100% plasma cells. The patient underwent VAD chemotherapy, with quick response in terms of pain. The patient is a non-secretor/minimal secretor. She has a trace lambda light chain expression."
1718,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"He had multiple lytic lesions on his skull, scapula, sacrum, fevers, and was treated with Decadron and thalidomide. 3. Four cycles of VAD chemotherapy starting _%#MM2002#%_, ending on _%#MMDD2003#%_. 4. He received autologous bone marrow transplant on _%#MMDD2003#%_. Please note that priming for bone marrow transplant was complicated by multiple organ sepsis."
1719,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"She was found to have IgA kappa myeloma with greater than 2 g IgA and a beta 2 microglobulin of 3.3. She was treated with VAD and developed severe peripheral neuropathy. Because of cytogenetic abnormalities and her age, she was evaluated for transplant and was found to be a candidate for a tandem autograft/allograft bone marrow transplant."
1720,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"Bone marrow biopsy had 50% plasma cells. X-ray showed involvement in bilateral humerus, left femur, right ischium, left clavicle and inferior part of the left scapula. She was treated with VAD chemotherapy. Now here for chemo-priming for autologous stem cell collection. ALLERGIES: Patient has allergy to Relafen."
1721,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"A CT scan revealed a large mediastinal mass, without evidence of disease below the diaphragm. Bone marrow pathology was negative at that time. The patient received four cycles of VAD chemotherapy, followed by mediastinal radiation through _%#MM1996#%_. The patient did well for a year, and then re-presented with right axillary node enlargement."
1722,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"In _%#MM#%_ 2002, he developed a pulmonary embolus that was treated for six months with heparin. Thalidomide was discontinued and he was treated with four cycles of VAD chemotherapy, which ended on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003. He is currently status post chemo and priming an autologous stem cell collection."
1723,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,Bone survey and protein electrophoresis are pending. IMPRESSION: Multiple myeloma with evidence of significant bone involvement and compression fracture of the back. PLAN: Will admit the patient to medical oncology floor starting on IV fluids and start regimen of VAD chemotherapy. I will have PICC line placed for chemotherapy and obtain blood count prior to starting. He will be placed on antiemetics and Decadron orally.
1724,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"Workup eventually lead to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. She was found to have 53% plasma cells in her bone marrow biopsy. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was treated with VAD chemotherapy which was effective at dropping her bone marrow involvement to 3%. In _%#MM2001#%_, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was referred to the Fairview-University Medical Center for a workup for an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant."
1725,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,He was treated with the M2 protocol and had a good partial response. His disease progressed in 2000. He was treated with 4 cycles of VAD chemotherapy. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ then underwent an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant in 2001 at the University of Wisconsin _%#CITY#%_ with a chemotherapy only preparative regimen.
1726,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"He also developed herpes simplex of his lower lip, for which he was treated adequately, and he has been maintained on prophylaxis in his midcycle of chemotherapy. Overall, his response to the VAD was excellent, with his beta 2-microglobulin going to 1.7, which is within the normal range, and his IgG level going down from 4.4 gm to 1.1. Reevaluation of his staging workup after his third cycle of VAD shows IgG down to 1.07, and beta 2-microglobulin down to 1.5. IgM and IgA are still low at 17 and 37, respectively."
1727,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"He was found at that time to have multiple myeloma, at which time he had anemia and 30% plasma cells in his bone marrow. He was initially treated with melphalan and prednisone, and then received three cycles of VAD chemotherapy, ending in mid _%#MM#%_, 2001. He underwent 1200 cGy total body irradiation between _%#MMDD2002#%_ and _%#MMDD2002#%_ prior to autologous bone marrow transplant."
1728,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,On _%#MMDD2002#%_ cycle #2 of VAD. Patient's IgG decreased to 4.8 gm in _%#MM2002#%_ and then 3.1 gm in _%#MM2002#%_.

Multiple myeloma with plasmacytoma as above.
1729,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,The patient had an epidural mass in the thoracolumbar spine on evaluation with symptoms of ataxia. The symptoms have resolved after 2 cycles of VAD. Her treatment was somewhat complicated with ARDS which required a prolonged hospitalization.
1730,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"She had a relapse in _%#MM2003#%_, with bone marrow involvement and plasmacytoma involving T8 with a compression fracture. The T8 lesion was treated with local radiation and a cycle of VAD chemotherapy in _%#MM2003#%_. A bone marrow biopsy after the first cycle of VAD showed 50% of plasma cells. She was subsequently treated with the first cycle of EDAP on _%#MMDD2003#%_, and is currently admitted for her third cycle."
1731,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,The patient tolerated this well. He demonstrated very minimal side effects consisting of mild constipation. The patient will receive three more courses of VAD. The goal is to eventually get him to bone marrow transplant. The patient will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the Hematology Clinic the Thursday before he is to be readmitted for his second cycle of VAD therapy.

1752,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Dear Dr. _%#NAME#%_: Thank you for the kind referral of your patient, _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, who was seen for genetic counseling at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, on _%#MMDD2006#%_. As you know, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ came to us for a second opinion regarding a CVS result, which was mosaic for trisomy 2. This CVS was performed at Abbott Northwestern Hospital. This letter will summarize our 45-minute discussion."
1753,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Screening tests, such as first trimester screen, provide risk assessments for specific conditions, but cannot definitively diagnose or exclude these conditions. Diagnostic tests, such as CVS and amniocentesis can definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of certain chromosome conditions, but are associated with a small risk of miscarriage."

1755,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Therefore, a maternal serum alpha fetoprotein is recommended at 16 weeks gestation. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them."
1756,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Patients who elect to forgo modified sequential screening should still be offered maternal serum AFP screening for spina bifida in the second trimester. * Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an invasive procedure that can diagnose chromosome conditions with 99% accuracy. There is a 0.5-1% risk of miscarriage associated with this procedure.
1757,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Both the chorionic villi sampling (CVS) procedure and the amniocentesis procedure were discussed as the only means of definitively diagnosing a numerical chromosome abnormality in a pregnancy. Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is nationally associated with a 1 in 200 (0.5%) to 1 in 100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1 in 200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."

1764,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"At the conclusion of our discussion, the patient stated that she wished to proceed with first trimester screening as a means to help her decide about pursuing either CVS or amniocentesis. She stated that she was most likely going to pursue some form of definitive prenatal diagnosis, more likely the amniocentesis."
1765,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"However, without additional medical records or information regarding this child it is hard to suggest a specific risk for this pregnancy. When the CVS procedure was attempted today, it was determined that there was not enough sample obtained. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ offered to perform an amniocentesis at 14 to 15 weeks of pregnancy."

1770,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,We discussed that first trimester screening does not screen for spina bifida so it would be imperative for _%#NAME#%_ to have an AFP drawn at 15 weeks gestation as well as a Level II ultrasound at 18 to 20 weeks gestation to assess this pregnancy for open neural tube defects such as spina bifida. We discussed that diagnostic testing is available which can detect chromosome abnormalities with greater than 99% accuracy. CVS can be performed between 11 and 13 weeks gestation and carries a 1 in 200 risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis can test for both chromosome abnormalities as well as open neural tube defects with greater than 99% accuracy.

1773,CVS,"customer, value, service",HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 16-year-old white male with a known history of depression who presents to our service following an acute ingestion of approximately 40 CVS brand cold and flu pills containing dextromethorphan as well as acetaminophen. The patient was apparently reported to be found combative and hallucinating and required wrist restraints.
1774,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"She stated that she and her husband were planning to continue and go to counseling due to numerous other issues in their family and marriage. As you know, individuals having CVS should have a follow-up AFP drawn at 15 weeks and/or a Level II ultrasound at 18 to 20 weeks to screen for spina bifida."

1776,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Therefore, an AFP only blood screen after 14 weeks' gestation is recommended to screen for this possibility. We discussed options of continuation of pregnancy, termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks' gestation, or adoption if CVS results are abnormal. Finally, a detailed family history was also obtained at the time of visit."
1777,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"She reported no smoking, alcohol use or medications during her pregnancy aside from prenatal vitamins. She had an amniocentesis with her previous pregnancy and desired earlier screening, which would be CVS, which was planned today with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. We reviewed that at the age of 40 her chance to have a baby with any type of chromosome abnormality is approximately 1 in 65."
1778,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"In light of this risk we discussed the availability of prenatal testing and screening, prenatal testing that would be available to the patient includes chorionic villus sampling between 10 to 12 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis around 16 weeks gestation. The risk, benefits, and limitations to CVS and amniocentesis were compared. Both CVS and amniocentesis have the risk of miscarriage of 1:200.

We also discussed alternative testing, which would be amniocentesis. As you know, CVS does not screen for spina bifida thus a followup AFP and/or level II ultrasound should be performed. We discussed options available if the baby was found to have an abnormality prenatally including continuation of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy after 24 weeks in the state of Minnesota."
1783,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Given the patient's early gestational age we discussed the availability of either CVS at 10 to 12 weeks gestation or amniocentesis after 15 weeks gestation. The risks, benefits, and limitations to both CVS and amniocentesis were compared for the patient.

1827,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Her labs suggest a cholestatic picture and remain largely unchanged from previous admissions. The patient has baseline jaundice that has not changed on this admission. The patient is on chronic SBP prophylaxis with Bactrim Double-Strength twice a week. Although the patient has no history of SBP, it is felt at this time that she is tolerating the drug well and will be continued on this regimen."
1828,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"The hematocrit was also less than 2. Further studies are pending, however, it seems unlikely that the patient has any evidence of SBP. Of note, the patient is also on SBP prophylaxis and we recommended that patient continued that. Given the patient's increasing needs for regular paracentesis recently, we have decided to refer the patient to Intervention Radiology for scheduled periodic abdominal paracentesis."
1829,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,We will add Nystatin powder to this for management purposes. 6. Deconditioning debility: Physical and occupational therapy will be provided. 7. SBP prophylaxis: The patient is currently on Levaquin and will continue on this medication until surgical evaluation.
1830,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Chemistries revealed a creatinine of 3.8, with a bicarbonate of 19, a potassium of 4.2, INR was 0.9, ammonia was 91, lipase 309, bilirubin 1.1, alkaline phosphatase 369, AST 148, ALT 69. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was admitted for abdominal paracentesis to rule out SBP in light of worsening mental status and increasing abdominal ascites. Gram stain of the peritoneal fluid revealed no organisms and a few neutrophils."
1831,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"He was receiving chemotherapy by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ with adriamycin. (Please see the admission H&P for the patient's family history, social history, admission medications, and physical examination). HOSPITAL COURSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma with increased abdominal pain: The patient underwent paracentesis to evaluate for SBP on his first hospital day. His peritoneal fluid returned negative for SBP. It was thought that his abdominal pain may be due to enlargement of his tumor."
1832,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"His lipase is also elevated, suggesting mild pancreatitis. The white count may be somewhat elevated due to hemoconcentration. a. Start Cipro and metronidazole for the SBP and diarrhea. b. Will check C. diff as well. 4. Hypotension. Again, this is mainly related to his hypovolemia, but absolutely cannot rule out sepsis syndrome."
1833,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"He was also started on rifaxamin. There was some concern about spontaneous bacterial peritonitis given his relatively sudden change in mental status. A diagnostic paracentesis was not easily performed on the floor. He was started on ceftriaxone empirically for possible SBP. On hospital day #2, he went to Interventional Radiology for a paracentesis there. About, 1.8 L of fluid was successfully removed. Fluid analysis showed 120 nucleated cells, only 7% of which were neutrophils."
1834,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Shortly thereafter the patient became apneic and required intubation. It was felt that it was secondary to benzodiazepines that he did receive. The temp was clear. Negative for SBP. After our intubation it was recommended that the patient be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at Fairview-University Medical Center for further management of the dependent patient as well as his pneumonia and end stage liver disease.
1835,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"The patient was felt to be mildly edematous. Lasix dosage was increased from 10 - 20 and spironolactone 15 mg p.o. q.d. was introduced. Furthermore, SBP prophylaxis was instituted with ciprofloxacin 750 mg p.o. q. weekly. PROBLEM #3: Chronic hepatitis C. PROBLEM #4: Organic personality disorder."
1836,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Therefore, the patient was instructed that when his 14-day course of ciprofloxacin finishes, he should start taking ciprofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once every week, so as to ensure that he does not get this infection again. He was also asked to follow up with the GI clinic with nurse practitioner in 2 weeks' time for followup of SBP and he was asked to retain his appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in _%#MM#%_ 2007. PROBLEM#2: Anemia. During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to be anemic."
1837,SBP,systolic blood pressure,"The patient's volume status should be followed closely and the need for Lasix as needed. ADDENDUM: The patient did have a spell before discharge; blood pressures were checked and apparently her SBP was in the 70's, but if this was completely accururate. Nonetheless, we will decrease her metoprolol to 50 mg XL q day. If she continues to have these spells after her sodium is corrected, or if she has more frequent spells, she will need more workup."
1838,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"This did not meet criteria for SBP, however, the patient had been treated with Unasyn at outside hospital so it was felt that it was possible that the patient may have a partially treated SBP. Also, the patient had cellulitic appearing rash on his right flank and leg with the appearance of a vesicular lesion. It was felt that the patient may also have a skin infection related to this."
1839,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,It should be of note that the patient reports having seen and discussing liver transplantation with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at Fairview University Medical Center at her most recent hospitalization. 3. Continue cefotaxime for the SBP though present cultures are negative. In all likelihood the patient will have a re-tap for ascites during this hospitalization and we can send this off for culture.
1840,SBP,systolic blood pressure,"3. Hypertension. He is on lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily, hold for SBP less than 110. He is also on diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily, hold for SBP less than 110. 4. Hyperlipidemia. He is on Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. 5. Dependent edema. He is on Lasix 40 mg p.r.n. approximately every other day with potassium 20 mEq approximately every other day with Lasix."
1841,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"In terms of the liver disease given the patient is still actively drinking certainly would not be a candidate for liver transplantation unless he was abstinent for a minimum of 6 months, preferably up to a year. His ascites was negative for SBP and is likely due to his liver disease as the ascitic fluid albumin level is not available to us at this time."

Paracentesis performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005 with removal of 3-1/2 liters and no evidence of SBP. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old man status post liver transplant who presents with fatigue, decreasing urine output, low appetite, and tarry black stools."

Cystic fibrosis-related lung disease. 5. History of SBP. 6. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 7. History of multiple episodes of DIOS (Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome). PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Living unrelated right lobe liver transplant _%#MMDD2007#%_.
1846,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,There is no obvious precipitating cause. There is no concomitant GI bleed that may have precipitated his encephalopathy. He is diffusely tender on exam and we would need to consider the possibility of SBP. His head CT is negative. He has a non-gap acidosis on his lytes which is likely secondary to bicarb loss with lactulose.
1847,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"PROBLEM #5: Infectious Disease. On admission, the patient was empirically started on cefotaxime for a possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A diagnostic paracentesis the next day was negative for SBP. Her white blood count remained mildly elevated but was most likely due to her hepatitis. The patient was given a five-day course of antibiotics (levofloxacin and then ceftriaxone) after her colonoscopy to prevent transient feeding of the ascites from her bowel."
1848,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"His tube feeds will be adjusted for a low sodium given his liver failure. INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Patient had occasional low-grade temperature. No clear evidence for infection. No SBP, no pneumonia. His urinalysis showed MSSA which is likely a contaminant, sensitive to Levaquin. He did receive several doses of Levaquin. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Physical therapy, occupational therapy consult, no NSAIDS, no aspirin, advanced directives, DNR/DNI."
1849,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Ultimately, she was diagnosed with hepatitis. She was hospitalized at Fairview University Hospital just a little over one week ago for abdominal swelling and variceal bleeding. She had banding at the time. SBP was also found. She was started on IV antibiotics. She has been at the _%#CITY#%_ Health Center receiving IV antibiotics since then."

1900,PE,pulmonary embolus,"2. Infectious Disease/sepsis: The patient was treated with IV antibiotics. This did evolve into a pneumonia which was changed to aggressive IV antibiotic therapy. She was ruled out for a PE. 3. Heme: Hemoglobin dropped from 9.8 to 8.3 postoperatively, and secondary to acute blood loss the patient did experience, concerns for initial DIC with elevated coagulopathy; however, platelets did remain stable, but the patient was transferred to the ICU for care."
1901,PE,pulmonary embolus,"There are regions of calcification in the left lung base and to a lesser degree in the left apex, which could represent postobstructive pneumonia. This mass extends into the aortic-pulmonary window and subcarinal region. Exam was suboptimal for PE, although no definite PE was noted. 2. Bronchoscopy dated _%#DDMM2005#%_ with findings: Bronchial washings positive for malignancy and consistent with small cell lung carcinoma."
1902,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She has no history of atrial fibrillation. She has a history of left bundle branch block, but has never been told that she had a myocardial infarction. No known CAD history to her knowledge. No DVT or PE history. No heart failure history. In the ER, the patient was noted to have a heart rate in the 140 range."
1903,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Her goal INR would be 2 to 2.5, and she should continue on Coumadin for 6 months and her IVC filter should be kept up to 6 months. The patient was seen by the hematology team that thought the most likely cause of her PE is because of her bed immobilization secondary to her pneumonia. There is no evidence of coagulation abnormality in her and in her family, and no further work up is necessary."
1904,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She presented to the Emergency Department this morning where she was evaluated. Her initial troponin and myoglobin were normal. She underwent a CT scan of the chest to look for PE. This was negative. Also of note her D-Dimer was negative. An EKG showed a sinus rhythm, rate of 72 with a left bundle branch block."
1905,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She currently lives with her husband. She has been in and out of the hospital recently, with a decrease in her ability to function in her daily activities. PROCEDURES: 1. CT of chest without evidence of PE. There is a patchy ground-glass attenuation of the transplant lung, but is much less extensive compared to previous study. 2. Echocardiogram showed mild LVH with a normal global LV systolic function."
1906,PE,pulmonary embolus,"NEUROLOGIC: The patient appears grossly intact and nonfocal. SKIN: No significant rashes or lesions. LABORATORY DATA: Lower extremity ultrasound is negative for DVT. Chest CT scan is negative for PE, but does show a right-sided infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Troponin level was 0.05. BNP was 525. D. dimer is 2.1. Coagulation studies are essentially normal."
1907,PE,pulmonary embolus,"He does not have any lower extremity edema. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Spinal stenosis with polyradiculopathy status post laminectomy, deconditioning secondary to pulmonary embolus. Begin a bowel program, DVT, and PE management for primary care physician converting to Coumadin. DISCHARGE PLANNING: We will schedule another conference. Again, estimated length of stay is 7 to 10 days with a good prognosis."
1908,PE,pressure equalization,"We did discuss the possible interaction of beta blockers and depressive-type symptoms, and I recommended that he follow up with his primary care doctor for advice in this regard. 2. Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. 3. Recent PE tube placement in the right ear for correction of chronic otitis with hearing loss. 4. History of concussion with brief loss of consciousness one year ago."

1910,PE,pressure equalization,"This revealed fullness in the left nasopharynx without mucosal lesion. There was a palpable mass at left level 2A, not discrete, and serous otitis media on the left. He placed a PE tube on the left ear drum and referred the patient to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and to us. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ saw the patient earlier today and apparently recommended combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy."
1911,PE,pressure equalization,3. History of fracture of his left hand. 4. Chemical-dependency with marijuana. SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Tonsillectomy. 2. PE tubes placed. ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: Concerta 54 mg p.o. q. day. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. Environmental allergy to dust.
1912,PE,pressure equalization,"_%#NAME#%_ lives at home with older half brother and half sister, each from parents' previous relationship. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for bilateral PE tubes inserted at age 3 associated with hearing loss and dysarthria. Adenoidectomy earlier than that. He was a term birth with low Apgar scores."
1913,PE,UNSURED SENSE,"The patient had sudden onset of chest pain yesterday evening, ranks it a 7.5 out of 10. This occurred under her left breast. It is nonstop and today it is worse. It is very similar to the PE pain she had in 2000 when she was hospitalized here. The patient says it does not radiate. It is not associated with diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting."
1914,PE,pulmonary embolus,"We will notify the covering oncologist of the patient's admission, and we will ask for any additional input in the meantime. The patient's symptoms could be PE or sepsis and respiratory alkalosis. Because of the patient's prior history of PE, he is at high risk that he may have recurrence at this point. This differential diagnosis was discussed with the patient's family members."
1915,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She has no seasonal allergies and no sinusitis. No GERD, no triggering factors. No family history of asthma and no pleurisy, leg swelling, phlebitis or PE. No fevers, chills. She has had some sweats. No weight loss. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She snores, no known apnea but she is not refreshed upon awakening."
1916,PE,pulmonary embolus,She notes that she has been sick with a cough productive of thick yellowish green sputum for approximately two weeks. She has a history significant for a PE in the past. Upon initial presentation she had a temperature of 101 and a left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient was placed on the community acquired pneumonia pathway and a pulmonary consultation was obtained.

Status post PE tube placement. 4. History of occasional headaches. 5. Asperger's. This was diagnosed last Wednesday. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies."
1920,PE,pulmonary embolus,"I will order lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds to evaluate for potential underlying DVT. If there is no evidence of DVT, it is possible that the PE could have originated from the pelvic veins. The patient also has evidence of hypokalemia which will require correction."
1921,PE,pulmonary embolus,"CARDIAC/RESPIRATORY: Please see HPI. GI: Positive for 1% of diarrhea last week not bloody, which resolved. GU: Positive for nocturia x3 unhelped by either Flomax or Uroxatral. No bleeding tendencies. ORTHOPEDIC: No previous PE or DVT. Lately he has had very poor quality sleep, daytime fatigue, no fever but he did have the shaking chills last night."
1922,PE,pulmonary embolus,"LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 119, potassium 4.3, chloride 85, CO2 of 25, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 119, myoglobin 51, troponin less than 0.3, hemoglobin 15.6, white blood count 5,000, platelet count 187,000. IMPRESSION: 1. Probable pulmonary embolism. Preliminary chest CT suggests a PE. She also has tachypnea and mild tachycardia. Her leg exam, however, is unremarkable for DVT and there is no history of any chest pain or even significant dyspnea."
1923,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She has no history of ulcers or heartburn. No loss of consciousness or syncope. No MI, CAD, COPD history. No DVT or PE history. In the ER, the patient's vital signs were notable for a temperature of 99.7 and saturation 98% on room air."
1924,PE,pulmonary embolus,1. Chest pain -- concern for unstable angina given her history. Gastrointestinal etiologies such as esophageal spasm could also present with this picture. PE less likely with her negative CT scan. Plan will be to admit to telemetry for monitoring. Follow serial troponins. Hold heparin unless change in troponins or EKG and keep patient n.p.o. for possible stress test versus angiogram in the morning.
1925,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Prominent interstitium with approximately 1.8 cm mass or conglomerate of lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum. Additional enlarged lymph nodes noted in the right tracheal brachial region measuring 1.5 cm. No evidence of a PE. Influenza swab is negative. Her pro-BNP is 11,100. Electrolytes demonstrates a creatinine of 0.75. Nonspecific LFTs with a AST of 79, ALT 68."
1926,PE,pulmonary embolus,"The patient has a past history of pulmonary emboli and was started on Lovenox 40 mg once a day for prophylaxis for PE. The day after surgery, his hemoglobin is 8.4 after hydration and then two days after was 7.4. The patient probably has had some chronic anemia and she was asymptomatic."
1927,PE,pulmonary embolus,"DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction, pleurisy, and hemoptysis. 2. Depression. MAJOR INVESTIGATIONS DONE DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. CT scan of the chest, PE protocol done on _%#DDMM2007#%_. The CT scan showed a small pulmonary embolus in the left medial basal segment of the pulmonary artery with an area of ground glass opacity consistent with ischemia or early infarction of the lung parenchyma."
1928,PE,pulmonary embolus,"He returned for reevaluation on _%#DDMM2005#%_. At that time, he was referred for a CT. He was found to have extensive bilateral nonocclusive pulmonary emboli. He has no real risk factors for PE such as prolonged travel, fracture or known malignancy. He has no localizing symptoms that would suggest malignancy. I did initiate a hypercoagulability workup."
1929,PE,pulmonary embolus,"CONSULTATIONS: Pulmonary. PROCEDURES: 1. He had a CAT scan of his lungs which showed the right upper lobe pneumonia, but no evidence of a PE. 2. He also an ultrasound of both legs which did not show a deep venous thrombosis. He had a sed rage which was 90 and angiotensin converting enzyme level which was normal and a neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody screen which was negative."
1930,PE,pulmonary embolus,"(My note: Consolidation was very wedge-shaped and peripheral, reviewed with Pulmonology, and it was felt this could very well be consistent with a peripheral PE with pulmonary infarct.) 2. Ventilation-perfusion scan was officially read as low probability scan for pulmonary embolism with a ventilation defect in the right lower lobe but no corresponding perfusion defect, and there was a small matched ventilation-perfusion defect in the left lower lobe."
1931,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Because the patient's DVT and PE were over a year ago and the recommended treatment is Coumadin for three to six months, it was felt that the Coumadin could be discontinued as well as the heparin, which could be increasing the DIC. It was felt that if the patient needed protection against further PE, a Greenfield filter could be placed if this was felt to be appropriate, considering her long- term prognosis as well as code status."
1932,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She passed flatus but had not had a bowel movement at the time of discharge. On postoperative day #1, she had some chest pain and shoulder pain and had a workup for a PE which was negative. She was seen by the hospitalist and the findings were felt to be negative. She did have some residual hypertension. Her blood pressure has been in the 140's/70-80's."
1933,PE,pulmonary embolus,"He had some dyspnea with wheezing as well. He saw his physician at Park Nicollet Clinic and was sent to Fairview Southdale Emergency Room. There chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest showed no PE. It showed chronic right upper lobe changes along with probable acute left-sided infiltrate. After admission and blood cultures were done, he was started on Rocephin and Zithromax."
1934,PE,pulmonary embolus,We checked the D-Dymer which was slightly elevated and then proceeded to check CT scan of the chest to rule out PE which was negative for PE. There was focal lingular density which the radiologist felt was atelectasis but they did recommend a follow-up CT scan or chest x-ray in three months to ensure resolution.
1935,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She was kept on Coumadin. She presented to Fairview Northland Hospital with acute onset of chest pain, shortness of breath that woke her up from sleep. A CT scan of the chest was done to rule out PE. There was no PE on exam, however. She had a large pericardial effusion. She was transferred to University of Minnesota Medical Center for further management."
1936,PE,pulmonary embolus,"3. Benadryl 25 mg q.6h. p.r.n. pruritus. 4. Tylenol 650 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain or fever. 5.

Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q. day for hypothyroidism. 8. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q. day for ulcer."
1937,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Neuro: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, nonfocal. LABORATORY DATA: Chest CT of the chest with IV contrast shows no evidence of dissection, masses or adenopathy. Limited opacification of smaller vessels with some decreased filling but no definitive PE or central PE. Cannot rule out small right lower lobe PE per Radiology. No infiltrate or pneumothorax. Sodium was 141, potassium 3.8, glucose 80, creatinine 0.7, bicarb 24, chloride 106, BUN 9.0, WBC 5.5, hemoglobin 12.6, normal differential."
1938,PE,pulmonary embolus,"This PE is in a different location than the PE in _%#DDMM2006#%_. It is probably attributable to a subtherapeutic INR, but hematology consult was requested due to recurrent PE on anticoagulation. They recommended lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin testing which are pending at the time of discharge. Hematology also recommended an adjustment in Coumadin dosing which is being made on discharge."
1939,PE,pulmonary embolus,"They are most prominent in the apices, and one would expect them in the bases for pulmonary fibrosis, but given her family history, this at least needs to be considered. In addition to therapy for COPD, she will be continued on her home medication and be treated with PE prophylaxis. We will check a nasal swab for influenza, and if the rapid antigen is positive, Tamiflu will be initiated as well."
1940,PE,pulmonary embolus,"7. History of appendectomy and hysterectomy in 1993. PROCEDURES DONE DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. CT scan of chest with PE protocol, which was done on _%#DDMM2007#%_. It was negative for PE, but did show multiple superior mediastinal lymph nodes and some hiatal hernia with some right apical blebs. The report also included seeing some upper and lower paratracheal adenopathy with the largest measuring 1.3 cm in shot axes."
1941,PE,pulmonary embolus,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Pulmonary embolism. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history significant for kidney and pancreas transplant who has a recurrent PE. She was first diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism about 3 months ago. There were no clear inciting factors at the time. There was no extensive travel, surgery, illness or bedrest."
1942,PE,pulmonary embolus,"2. Hypoxia. The patient has a long history of tobacco use and may have some underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is contributing in an acute manner. The possibility of PE still exists, though this appears less likely given the relatively normal CT scan. Her fever and left lower lobe crackles could be early signs of a developing pneumonia, though she is without an elevated white blood count or other symptoms at this time and this can be monitored clinically and if she has more symptoms treat appropriately."
1943,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Would also encourage good blood pressure and cholesterol control. History of breast cancer. The patient had been on tamoxifen for 3 years. Due to her recent PE and a small risk from this from tamoxifen, her tamoxifen was discontinued. However, I would like to have her follow up fairly quickly with her oncologist about this change in her medication."
1944,PE,pulmonary embolus,"10. There was evidence of fluid overload despite her normal EF, consistent with diastolic dysfunction. Lasix has been given. She did have episodes of shortness of breath with hypoxemia, but there was no PE seen on CT of her lung. A followup chest x-ray is pending for today, and she will be discharged on some Lasix."

I have also recommended the following: 1. Check perioperative CEA level. 2. Consider CT/PET scan as an outpatient. 3. Follow up in my clinic after recovery from surgery (approximately 2-3 weeks) to discuss all surgical pathology and the possibility of adjuvant treatment."
2403,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She was admitted to the hospital on _%#MMDD#%_, where she was noted to be hypercalcemic and also had an elevated CEA. She had received chemotherapy a few days earlier with carboplatin/VP-16. She was noted to have abnormal liver functions with an elevated alkaline phosphatase at 755, AST 76, albumin 3, calcium 11.7.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and PCI. The patient has been asymptomatic from a cardiac prospective. He was recently evaluated for CEA, and he was sent for an adenosine stress test. The adenosine stress test showed LV dilatation, reversible defect of anteroapical and inferoseptal region."
2405,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"It is unclear as to whether or not this is secondary to an adrenalin stress response in addition to his bowel obstruction or if this is due to the fact that he had coffee and cookies previously. We will check hemoglobin A1C on the patient. 4. History of gastric cancer. His CEA was mildly elevated approximately one year ago. CEA will be obtained presently in this patient, as to whether or not there has been a dramatic increase from his previous mild elevation."
2406,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"This note will also suffice for the preoperative history and physical, as well as his consultation. We are sending him to the hospital for some laboratory work including a CEA, CA 99 and a PSA. I am also scheduling Mr. _%#NAME#%_ for a PET CT scan for further staging purposes as well."

IMPRESSION: A 65-year-old male with a Duke's C2 colon carcinoma (T4N2M0), with growth extension of his tumor to the parietal peritoneum."
2409,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. The patient had a colonoscopy in the last six months as she has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as colon cancer in the past. C-A 99, as well as CEA tumor markers came back negative. The liver was unremarkable and adrenal examination revealed simple adenomas only."
2410,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She has metastatic colon cancer from _%#MM1999#%_ with a grade 3, stage 3 adenocarcinoma, status post right hemi. She received adjuvant chemotherapy. Her CEA rose. She had omental mets. Port-A-Cath was placed. CAVO chemotherapy was started. CEA began to fall and then started rising again in _%#MM2003#%_."
2411,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Glucose 105. BUN 24. Creatinine 0.6. Magnesium 2.0. Phosphorus 3.8. Histopathology report from T12 vertebral body showed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with lung primary. CEA on _%#MMDD2006#%_ was 5.3, with a normal range of 0 to 2.5. PSA was 2.08. RADIOLOGY: CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis done on _%#MMDD2006#%_ showed a 1.6 cm spiculated pleural-based nodule in the right upper lobe, which was increased from 1.1 cm in _%#MM2004#%_."
2412,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"All of these show only the scar in the ablated areas of her liver. They are unchanged and there is no evidence of recurrent malignancy. In addition, her serum tumor markers CA125 and CEA levels have remained normal. _%#NAME#%_ currently is being maintained on alternating sequence of tamoxifen 20 mg b.i.d. for three weeks, alternating with Megace 80 mg b.i.d. for three weeks."
2413,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,I also discussed the patient's problem with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ and he will see her in consultation for consideration of treatment of the ovarian cancer. Of note is that the CEA and CA-125 drawn at Methodist Hospital are pending.
2414,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She has completed cycle #2 day 15, and most recent CT scan obtained approximately four weeks ago revealed a dramatic improvement in her liver metastasis with a decrease in the overall size of her liver. Her retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy had largely resolved. Unfortunately, her CEA level, as well as her CA-99 have remained elevated, however, clinically she has continued to improve. She comes into the office today for continuation of her chemotherapy and a preoperative visit."
2415,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"LABORATORY DATA: Include a presurgical CBC with a white blood cell count of 6000, hemoglobin of 13.7, MCV of 88, platelet count of 282,000 with normal differential. A CEA level and hepatic panel are pending (ordered today). ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Stage III (T3 N2 MX) rectal carcinoma -- it appears _%#NAME#%_ has had a curative surgery based on her clear resection margins on the surgical pathology report."
2416,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The lower extremities reveal no edema. LABORATORY: Laboratory studies on admission include an alkaline phosphatase of 100, ALT 25, AST 21, total bilirubin 1.1, and albumin 3.6. CEA level less than 0.5. Hemoglobin 13.1 (MCV 91). White blood count 8000. Platelet count 459,000. IMPRESSION: A 61-year-old female with Duke's C2 colon carcinoma, status post left hemicolectomy."
2417,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Subsequently, she did undergo a liver biopsy on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, which revealed a poorly differentiated nonsmall cell carcinoma. The suggested primary sites were broad but by immunohistochemical testing it was negative for AFP, CEA, CA19-9, thyroglobulin. It was positive for cytokeratin 7 and 20, which is commonly seen in upper digestive tract malignancy and possibly bladder cancer."
2418,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. ASSESSMENT & PLAN: The patient has no physical evidence of progression of disease. It is somewhat worrisome that her CEA is up, but will be keep watching that to see if it is just within a normal swing for her. She will continue on her Herceptin and her Arimidex. If her markers keep going up, we will have to consider returning to chemotherapy."
2419,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Beginning last _%#MM#%_, she was placed on Xeloda and this resulted in a fairly prolonged period of stabilization, but no actual change in her CEA levels. By _%#MM#%_ of this year, there was some progression in the omentum with peritoneal metastases. Her CEA, at that time, was over 200. We started her on a new regimen in _%#MM#%_, using CPT-11, and she has been on an every- other-week regimen since that time."
2420,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Therefore, I discussed at length today with _%#NAME#%_, the high likelihood that she will ultimately be provided 5FU based systemic chemotherapy once she recovers from her surgery. I will simply await the results of the CEA level and likely obtain a new CT scan of the chest and/or PET scan as an outpatient prior to further discussion regarding treatment."
2421,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"ADL STATUS: Energy - she has a little more energy. Eating: Better. Sleeping: Well. Maintaining weight: Yes. LABORATORY DATA: Markers are up with her CEA being up to 385, CA19-9 will not be back until next week. FAMILY HISTORY/SOCIAL HISTORY: No change since _%#MM2004#%_. ALLERGIES: No known allergies PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 108/64, pulse 68, respirations 16, temperature 98, and weight 115, height 5'4""."
2422,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"White count at that time was 4500 with a hemoglobin of 13.9. Other labs on _%#MMDD2002#%_ was a normal comprehensive panel, a CA-125 of 5.4, CEA of 1.4, amylase 65, lipase 38, H. pylori was negative. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: With her in the American Society of Anesthesiology Category of P-2 with her history of hypertension well controlled and diabetes well controlled, recent UTI, however with recent culture negative and currently asymptomatic, would request that cath specimen be done at the time she enters the hospital for clean catch UA to make sure that is clear."
2423,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,Speech and language consult was placed. He was found to demonstrate pooling without penetration or aspiration and it is recommended he continues on a regular diet with thin liquids and use of a chin tuck. The patient has a history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. He has elevated CEA and was seen by Urology and while an inpatient did receive Zoladex for this condition. He has a history of arthrosclerotic cardiovascular disease with inferior wall ischemia and chronic atrial fibrillation.
2424,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ is a 70-year-old gentleman who has history of colorectal cancer in the past. Recently he had arising CEA. A PET scan demonstrated a high intake in the liver. The patient was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the clinic in relation to the management options of persistent lesion in segment 6A/4A at the right lobe of liver.
2425,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"He was treated with six months of FU and Leucovorin. He then had his colostomy taken down. He did well, however, this summer he noted to have elevation of CEA level. CT scan done and appeared to having isolated mesenteric metastasis near the superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein."
2426,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,Hopefully chemotherapy would be somewhat beneficial. SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY DATA: Revealed a C-A-125 elevated at 76. CEA elevated at 2.9. Normal liver function tests. Hemoglobin of 12.9. The patient was ready for discharge to home doing quite well on the eighth postoperative day.

IMPRESSION: The patient with a very unusual, large liver mass with some calcifications and necrotic areas with no GI symptoms at all, completely asymptomatic."
2428,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Her hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen were studied as part of the evaluation and were found to be negative. Her liver function tests were found to be within normal limits: alkphos 77, ALT 10. CEA and CA19-9 were performed and her CEA was 21 and CA19-9 was 65, which was elevated. A GI consult was obtained to assist in evaluating her liver cysts and ascites."
2429,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"He is status post subtotal colectomy with ileocecal anastomosis in _%#MM#%_ 2005. Initially, _%#NAME#%_ had been managed as an outpatient with 5-FU therapy but was found to have climbing CEA levels and a new mass at the dentate line. He had this mass removed in _%#MM#%_ 2006 and was then started on regimen similar to the FOLFOX/7 regimen."
2430,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"She has cerebral vascular disease, status post CEA on the right. She has diabetes and hypertension.

2432,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,His daughter was in favor of this and we left it that they would see me back in the clinic in approximately three weeks. We will recheck his blood counts at that time along with a CEA tumor marker.
2433,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"LABORATORY: Please note the pelvic ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound findings described in the history of present illness. CA-125 was 12, CEA was normal at 1.5. HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient had an uncomplicated hospital course. She was transferred from the Post-Anesthesia Unit in stable condition."
2434,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"At this point she is in remission after dissection, and her risk of recurrence is really exceedingly low. PLAN: We could consider a baseline CT scan postoperatively, and then I would consider monitoring her with periodic CEA laboratory evaluation. The most important part of her follow-up, however, will be with serial colonoscopies. My suggestion is that she have a repeat colonoscopy obtained roughly one year from now."

2463,CVP,central venous pressure,"4. Hypotension, matter of grave concern. She is on pressers already. We will give her a significant amount of IV fluids and monitor on CVP. We will definitely keep it at 12. 5. Acute renal insufficiency secondary to more likely than not it is prerenal in nature at this point in time."
2464,CVP,central venous pressure,"He subsequently had adrenal insufficiency. He has received chemotherapy for this. His last chemotherapy was _%#MMDD2002#%_. That was cycle 3 of CVP. The patient had been having problems with mental status change and irritability, possibly related to his chemotherapy or his prednisone."
2465,CVP,central venous pressure,PLAN: 1. Admit to the Intensive Care Unit. 2. Start aggressive IV fluid replacement. 3. I would aim for a CVP of around 10. CVP currently is 2 after three liters of normal saline. 4. I will start him on renally-dosed Zosyn and vancomycin. 5. I will continue his Lovenox at 1 mg/kg b.i.d.
2466,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","She did not require treatment until 2002. She was treated with Cytoxan for 3 months and had a good partial response. In 2004 she had progression of her abdominal adenopathy and was treated with CVP and Rituxan. Once again, she had a good partial response.

GENERAL: The patient is lying in bed, obtunded, with marked jaundice and scleral icterus."
2470,CVP,central venous pressure,"There was normal function and a small patent foramen ovale with a left to right shunt. On _%#MMDD2007#%_ she had an echocardiogram which showed pulmonary hypertension with estimated right ventricular pressures of 50 mmHg plus CVP. She did have good left ventricular and right ventricular function with a small patent foramen ovale. In reviewing her recent chest x-rays, she did have a chest x-ray on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which shows hazy coarse opacities through both lungs which suggested possible edema superimposed on BPD with an increasing heart size."
2471,CVP,central venous pressure,"The lung parenchyma appears to be clear. On review of CT scan from 2006 the lung parenchyma appeared to be essentially normal with no evidence of pleural effusions at that time. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Severe pulmonary hypertension: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 46-year-old woman with evidence of severe right ventricular failure as evidenced by her markedly elevated CVP on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ as well as her relatively low mean pulmonary artery pressures, which is likely indicative of her frank RV failure."

His pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 6. PA pressure is 47/18. However, I believe that this CVP and PA pressure were before diuresis, and this wedge pressure was after diuresis."
2477,CVP,central venous pressure,"Postoperatively the patient was admitted to the ICU due to oliguria in the operating room. She was at the ICU for CVP monitoring and serial hemoglobin monitoring. On postoperative day 1, the pain was not well-controlled by PCA. This was improved by increasing her basal rate. Otherwise drain output was appropriate."
2478,CVP,central venous pressure,"Blood pressure 84/62. Mean of 63. Pulse 75. GENERAL: He is alert and follows commands, moves all extremities.

RESPIRATORY: Bilateral breath sounds; no rhonchi or crepitations."
2479,CVP,central venous pressure,"I had good return in all three ports and the CVP was approximately 0 to -1 mmHg. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Hypovolemic shock, most likely septic and the tamponade is unlikely given the low CVP. We definitely need to rule out intra-abdominal source, as well as chest source, possibly mediastinitis, although, the subacute did open up the symptoms would speak against mediastinitis."
2480,CVP,central venous pressure,8. Code status was discussed; the patient is still discussing his code with his family and at this time would like to remain full code. PLAN: 1. Admit to the Intensive Care Unit. 2. Start aggressive IV fluid replacement. 3. I would aim for a CVP of around 10. CVP currently is 2 after three liters of normal saline. 4. I will start him on renally-dosed Zosyn and vancomycin.
2481,CVP,central venous pressure,"Any attempt to pull fluid off along with the continuous ultrafiltration resulted in decreased blood pressures, and the patient began to become fairly volume up. At 5 in the morning, the patient had been a net 15 L up. A CVP at this point was in the low 20s. Vasopressin was initiated, as the patient's blood pressure was not being supported with dopamine or Levophed."
2482,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone",PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in 1997 initially treated with eight cycles of CHOP. The patient relapsed. He then had six cycles of CVP. The patient also had right humerus involvement. The patient had partial remission treated with six cycles CVP. 2. Coronary artery bypass graft. 3. Hypertension. 4. Hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: See admission H and P.
2483,CVP,central venous pressure,"She did not have any treatment until 1993, and at that time apparently had disseminated adenopathy and a subcarinal mass. She was treated with chlorambucil until _%#MM#%_ 1993, and then was switched to the CVP regimen, which she received from _%#MM#%_ through _%#MM#%_ 1993, and the available records indicate a partial response. She was then treated with the CHOP regimen for a total of 8 cycles, with attainment of a sustained response until 1996."
2484,CVP,central venous pressure,CARDIOVASCULAR: LVAD flow is 4.6 L/minute at a fixed rate of 3650. RVAD flow is 4.8 at a fixed rate of 3250. CVP 12. RESPIRATORY: Bilateral breath sounds. Increased right basilar crepitations. Oxygen saturations 98% on 4 L nasal cannula. ABDOMEN: Soft. Bowel sounds present. Nondistended and nontender. EXTREMITIES: Lower extremities are warm and well perfused.
2485,CVP,central venous pressure,"8. Twitching prior to his sedation. I suspect this may be a drug toxicity effect given all that he is on chronically, especially the gabapentin, the dose of which would be quite excessive for his current level of kidney function. PLAN: 1. Volume support based on his CVP via the sepsis protocol. 2. Vasopressors. 3. Continuous monitoring of his mixed venous oxygen saturation. 4. Cosyntropin stem test and empiric stress dose steroid."
2486,CVP,central venous pressure,More recently he has had problems with the IV infusion in that the PICC line has become difficult to sample blood from and when an antibiotic is infused he will get a burning sensation in his chest and upper arms. Yesterday a chest x-ray was done which showed the tip of his CVP line in his superior vena cava in an acceptable location. The site of entry for his PICC line does not show any overt inflammatory signs and there is no tenderness in the upper arm or axilla.
2487,CVP,central venous pressure,"The neck is supple. There is no adenopathy. LUNGS: Clear bilateral breath sounds, no wheezes or rales. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. He has a CVP of about 10. He has a I/VI systolic murmur across the precordium and no rub. ABDOMEN: No bruits, normal bowel sounds. Soft and nontender. No hepatosplenomegaly."
2488,CVP,central venous pressure,"He is on a low dose of dopamine for blood pressure support. We are going to give him two units of packed cells. This will increase his CVP and perhaps the Dopamine can be weaned off. 6. Peritonitis. He is on Flagyl and Levaquin. We will send blood, sputum and urine cultures now."
2489,CVP,central venous pressure,"Serial EKGs were unchanged. His hemoglobin postoperatively was 10.9. At the time of evaluation by the cardiology resident, the patient's blood pressures were 90-100/40-50 with a normal sinus rhythm on his EKG. At that time, it was thought that it would be best to continue volume resuscitation following the CVP, check hemoglobins, troponins and EKG. The patient remained in the ICU overnight due to his hypotension. On postoperatively day #1, adult nephrology did see the patient."
2490,CVP,central venous pressure,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Not obtainable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure in the range of 90 to 100 systolic. His rhythm is irregularly irregular, but rate controlled, less than 100. He is afebrile. CVP is running in the range of 14. GENERAL: He is orally intubated. He has an NG placed. He has a right IJ triple lumen catheter in place with some oozing at the site."
2491,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","The last time he was treated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ was in _%#MM2004#%_ via chlorambucil. We will talk to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ about the next step in the patient's treatment, using either CVP with or without Rituxan versus Rituxan alone versus fludarabine and Rituxan together, in combination. Fludarabine was used a while ago. 4. Anemia, most likely from the disease, but we have to make sure that there is no element of hemolysis."
2492,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","She developed right neck lymphadenopathy that was biopsied in _%#MM2004#%_, and she was found to have transformed large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient was then treated with CVP and Rituxan for maintenance therapy. Unfortunately, in _%#MM2005#%_, she was diagnosed with an enlarging lesion in the mesentery and peripancreatic area despite the chemotherapy."
2493,CVP,central venous pressure,"He has ecchymoses over the skin and some limited mobility of his feet from contractures. Swan-Ganz remains in place with a PA pressure, CVP of 6, PA pressure 28/12. LABORATORY RESULTS: Blood gas: pH 7.41, pCO2 48, pO2 89, bicarb 30."
2494,CVP,central venous pressure,There is no need for dialysis at this point. All of this was discussed with the family. a. Will hold diuretics for now. b. If the CVP drops a little more than will give some albumin. c. We will follow a urine output and renal function closely.
2495,CVP,central venous pressure,"Does not smoke. ALLERGIES: NONE. MEDICATIONS: Apparently atenolol, Aldactone. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is sedated and nonresponsive, pulse is 97%, O2 sat is 100%, CVP is 5-6. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 151/98 initially driving down 125/70 after propofol. Respiratory rate 12. HEENT: Head shows no trauma. Pupils are mid position and fixed."
2496,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","He was then taken off of therapy for nearly one year when his disease recurred and he had a poor response to chlorambucil. He received an additional eight cycles of CVP given in the middle of the year of 2000 with satisfactory disease control. Again, in _%#MM2001#%_, his disease was active with lymphadenopathy. He had a white cell count of 248,000 at that time."
2497,CVP,central venous pressure,"Cardiac index was only 1.8. With intra-aortic balloon pump support and inotropes, his index has improved. However, he continues to be slightly hypertensive requiring inotropes and pressors. Of concern is his elevated CVP. I recommend that if we cannot get his CVP down with his current medical management, we should institute CVVH/D in order to remove the extra volume."
2498,CVP,central venous pressure,"3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension. 4. Normal left ventricular function on LV-gram. 2. Right heart catheterization, with hemodynamic evaluation. Results: 1. CVP: 8. 2. PA pressures: 39/22. 3. Pulmonary artery wedge pressures: 16. 4. Cardiac output: 5.6, with an index of 3.4. 3. Transesophageal echocardiogram. Results: 1.

2500,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She also had an MRA of the abdomen to rule out stenosis which showed mild to moderate stenosis of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, celiac access and inferior mesenteric artery, appeared to be patent proximally. A vascular surgery consultation was obtained and the recommendation was asymptomatic with 30-40% of SMA stenosis. No surgical intervention needed. At present, she denies any complaint. Her blood pressure ranged between systolic of 145-183 and diastolic 75-88, pulse 80, respiratory rate 18/minute."
2501,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,She is followed also and being seen concurrently by the Gastroenterology service. Under the direction of Dr. _%#NAME#%_ she was taken to the operating room today for an aortoceliac SMA bypass with cholecystectomy. Indication for this procedure was presumed mesenteric ischemia and her bowel was all deemed to be viable. Her operative course can be reviewed. She was seen and examined in the PAC postprocedure.
2502,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,12. Methotrexate injections. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: MAJOR DIAGNOSES: 1. Hyperlipidemia. 2. Hypertension. 3. Hypothyroidism. 4. Barrett's esophagitis with esophageal strictures. 5. Depression. 6. Meniere's disease. 7. SMA (superior mesenteric artery) stenosis. 8. Psoriatic arthritis. 9. Alcohol and chemical dependency. 10. Fibromyalgia. 11. Peripheral vascular disease 12. ASCVD. 13. Stress incontinence.
2503,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"ALLERGIES: THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and initially evaluated by the internal medicine team. She has had at that time full radiographic workup. This revealed that the SMA syndrome was persisting, causing her pain as well as some nausea and vomiting. General surgery consult was eventually obtained. The patient was eventually taken to the operating room for laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy."
2504,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She was subsequently scheduled for an MRI of her abdomen which revealed a significantly appearing stenosis of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, and the origin of the SMA was felt to be small in caliber and just beyond the first mm. there was a high grade appearing SMA stenosis. The celiac as well as the internal mammary artery were patent. Because of this, the patient is now scheduled for an angiogram with possible angioplasty to the SMA at Fairview Southdale Hospital on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_."
2505,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"In its most severe form, SMA is lethal. SMA is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, which means that both parents have to be carriers in order to have a chance of having a child affected with the condition. We would not expect carriers themselves to have any features of SMA. _%#NAME#%_ reports that neither of her parents have had genetic testing, but it is quite likely that they are both carriers of this condition."
2506,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"This is characteristic of SMA, although, the autosomal dominant parents' pattern is not typical. Based upon his description of what he has been told by various neuromuscular neurologists, it appears that they concur that this is a form of SMA that is atypical, but that there is no other substantial diagnostic consideration. I explained the following with respect to his procedure: 1. His anesthesiologist needs to be aware that he has a neuromuscular disorder and that a genetically determined myopathy cannot be excluded at present."
2507,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The patient subsequently had a nuclear medicine bleeding study done which showed possible active bleeding site within the right pelvis. The patient underwent subsequent visceral angiogram which showed normal celiac, normal SMA, a very small but patent IMA could not be selectively catheterized. After all this workup was thought that the patient's anemia is most likely secondary to episodic diverticular tic bleeding."
2508,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"We had a consent form signed, and DNA was arranged from Nemours Clinic in _%#CITY#%_, Delaware, to be sent to the University of Pennsylvania for the linkage study. We discussed options available if the baby was found to have SMA prenatally, including continuation of a pregnancy or termination of a pregnancy. We thoroughly reviewed the remainder of the family history during our genetic counseling session."
2509,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"In addition, the patient's sister lost a pregnancy at 28 weeks gestation secondary to spinal muscular atrophy. The patient reports that her father as well as her sister and brother-in-law have had carrier testing for SMA and have all been found to be carriers. The patient's family history is also remarkable for her sister who has bipolar illness as well as her mother who has bipolar illness."
2510,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"She reported several members having cancer including her father with colon cancer in his 60s, a paternal uncle with pancreatic cancer in his 50s, and a paternal grandmother who had some sort of cancer in her 60s. _%#NAME#%_ reported that his brother had a son who was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in Colorado and passed away at 1 year of age. This occurred approximately 5 years ago. Both of them are of Northern European ethnicity."
2511,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She finally was evaluated again after discharge from _%#COUNTY#%_ _%#COUNTY#%_'s Hospital because she was ""sick and tired"" of the Woodwinds Hospital still not being able to diagnose her. At _%#COUNTY#%_ _%#COUNTY#%_'s Hospital, the patient did have a CT scan with contrast which did show a probable clot in the superior mesenteric artery, and she did undergo angiogram by Interventional Radiology, which did show approximately SMA focal 80% stenosis proximally and small streaming linear defect downstream questionable clot or dissection. The clot was occlusive to the extension of the mid to distal SMA and some occlusion of some branches going down to the jejunum."
2512,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"Additionally, ultrasounds would be available to the patient later on in the pregnancy around 18 to 20 weeks, as well as in her third trimester to again look for clinical ultrasound features of SMA. It was stressed to the patient that a normal ultrasound cannot rule out the current pregnancy as being affected with SMA. Given the patient's European Caucasian and her husband's German ethnic background we also briefly discussed the availability of cystic fibrosis carrier testing."
2513,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"On _%#MMDD2006#%_, we performed an MR angiogram, which really did not show any difference. Still some wall thickening of the distal small bowel with no evidence of obstruction of the SMA or IMA vessels. The patient had diet advanced during her hospitalization and on _%#MMDD#%_ and _%#MMDD#%_, she was eating a regular diet with no increased pain following that."
2514,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1) Chronic mesenteric ischemia. 2) Selective celiac and SMA arteriograms, stenting of the celiac artery x 2, stenting of the SMA. 3) Acute renal failure, now resolved. 4) Hypertension. 5) Transient atrial flutter."
2515,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"Genitalia/Spine/Lymphatics/ Musculoskeletal: Within normal limits. Skin: Dry, scaly over the face and much of the body consistent with eczema. Neurologic: Grossly intact. ADMISSION LABS: Included SMA 7 with a mildly elevated glucose at 126, otherwise within normal limits. CBC had clotted. UA was within normal limits. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to Smiley's team, was started on IV fluids with plan to continue breast feeding as tolerated."
2516,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"3. MRA of the abdomen dated _%#MMDD2004#%_. Findings: Celiac and superior mesenteric occlusion or thrombus. There is no renal artery stenosis. There is some reconstitution of flow in the SMA, a few centimeters beyond it's origin. There is a focal area of high T2 signal on the spleen, probably splenic infarct."
2517,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"GI and psychiatry consultations were obtained on admission. _%#NAME#%_ continued with some nausea and occasional vomiting for approximately 2 days. These symptoms then resolved. Gastroenterology was involved and recommended and upper GI to rule out SMA syndrome. The upper GI was normal. After that, they performed EGD which scheduled mild, erythematous gastropathy, duodenitis, and a small hiatal hernia."
2518,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"This was felt secondary to his small-bowel lymphoma, likely exacerbated by his anticoagulation. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, mesenteric angiogram of the IMA and SMA; the IMA angiogram revealed an aneurysm of the branch supplying the left lower colon. SMA showed active extravasation of the proximal jejenum branch that was felt to lie close to an apparent bowel suture line from previous small-bowel resection."
2519,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The patient's been on NG decompression for relief of symptoms. The leading thought this time, after discussion with Dr. _%#NAME#%_, is the patient may have SMA syndrome. The patient denies any nonsteroidals. He is reporting his abdominal discomfort is somewhat better. He still complains of occasional nausea. He denied any chest pain or shortness of breath."
2520,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"Gastrografin enema was consistent with a dilated terminal ileum with no peristomal hernia. CT at that time was consistent with a possible SMA syndrome; however, subsequent CT scans have been negative. The last abdominal CT was in _%#MM#%_ 2002. 3. Hernias at her ostomy site."
2521,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"On presentation his blood pressure was 82/56 secondary to SL-NTG given by paramedics. His exam was positive only for bronchial breath sounds. Had some bruises on his back. D. dimer 0.9. Otherwise CBC, SMA, troponin negative. Ethanol level zero, although he reportedly drank earlier that day. A chest x-ray revealed blunting of the right costophrenic angle with hazy infiltrates."
2522,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"FOLLOW UP: 1. An appointment has been arranged with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ from neurology for followup of her lower extremity weakness on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, at 9:30 a.m. 2. An appointment has been arranged with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ from gastroenterology. To follow up her SMA stenosis within one month. 3. She will need to see her primary care physician within 2 weeks for followup on her secondary adrenal insufficiency, hypercholesterolemia, and hypokalemia."
2523,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Enoxaparin 70 mg subcutaneously q. 12h. until 24-48 hours after INR therapeutic. 2. Warfarin 2 mg p.o. daily for SMA clot, INR goal 2-3. 3. Prochlorperazine 10 mg p.o. q. 6h. p.r.n. nausea vomiting. 4. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. daily. 5. Oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q. 4h. as needed for pain."
2524,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,CT scan of the abdomen today is highly suspicious for an superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. He is transferred to Fairview Southdale Hospital for angiography. Angiography was performed revealing extensive SMA clot not amenable to surgical therapy and involving many secondary branches. He is currently on t-PA infusion with the hopes of inducing thrombolysis.
2525,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The patient was started on anticoagulation with enoxaparin. After discharge on _%#MMDD2007#%_, the patient was asked to return for elective SMA angiogram to follow up known SMA clot. Per discharge summary of _%#MMDD2007#%_, the patient had a Hematology workup for hypercoagulation stage, which was reportedly negative."
2526,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"I discussed these results with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ who was the radiologist performing the study. In retrospect, I ask him to review the CT and he does believe that the SMA and SMV both run through the tumor mass directly. ASSESSMENT: Large intra-abdominal lymphoma with GI hemorrhage and contained perforation of the duodenal distal to the ampulla."
2527,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She did start taking clears on hospital day #2 and then was tolerating small amounts of regular diet prior to discharge. 2. GI: _%#NAME#%_ has a known history of gastroparesis with recurrent nausea and vomiting. She also had a history of SMA syndrome, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Her liver panel and lipase were normal here. Her NJ was replaced without difficulty by interventional radiology and her feeds were resumed."
2528,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,Amylase 59. Sodium 143. Potassium 3.7. Chloride 106. CO2 27. BUN 14. Creatinine 0.9. Glucose 112. Calcium 8.5. IMAGING: CT scan done today report is 1) small amount of free air near the liver; 2) Malrotation with worsening volvulus and narrowing of the SMA; 3) small bowel dilation with extraluminal gas; 4) misty appearance of the mesentery possibly consistent with venous congestion.
2529,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"This is an extremely difficult situation and it has been discussed with the patient and his family with high risk of complications and possible extensive bowel infarction and perforation. However, with the extensive clot in his SMA, I do feel that TPA lytic therapy is the appropriate treatment. I do not feel that surgically we can even come close to removing this clot with mechanical thrombectomy."
2530,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"DISCHARGE PLAN: 1. Follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, at 10 a.m. 2. Follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_, primary care doctor on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, at 3:20 p.m. 3. Ultrasound of arteries including SMA and celiac axis on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, at 10 a.m. No food or drink 8 hours prior to this study. 4. Restart MS Contin 15 mg p.o. b.i.d. for chronic abdominal pain with immediate release morphine p.r.n. as needed for increasing pain."
2531,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,Concern again was for an intraabdominal process and she was sent for CT scan. CT scan showed pneumatosis intestinalis including pneumatosis in the portal system. She underwent arteriogram that showed an SMA occlusion and was taken to the operating room and underwent an exploratory laparotomy and SMA revascularization. Her bowel was markedly ischemic and there was a significant concern for complete gut infarction.
2532,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"The patient indicated at the time of her visit that she was not interested in pursuing carrier testing for SMA. We discussed the availability of ultrasounds throughout the pregnancy to screen for clinical features of early onset SMA such as fetal arthrogryposis. Specifically, we discussed the availability of first trimester screening. First trimester screening is typically used to screen for fetal chromosome issues, specifically Down syndrome and trisomy 18."
2533,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"Her abdomen is benign. LABORATORY: Preoperative hemoglobin 14.9, hematocrit 44.6. INR 1.07. CT angiogram on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, demonstrated a total liver volume of 1706 cc with the right lobe 1137 cc. There was a replaced right hepatic artery originating from the SMA. The left hepatic artery originates from the celiac axis. There is a normal portal-vein branching pattern and normal hepatic venous anatomy."
2534,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The largest lesion was appreciated in the liver and was sized at 8 x 6 cm. Also, appreciated was a left periaortic soft tissue mass at the level of SMA as well as a left adrenal lesion. The patient has sought multiple second opinions and has been seen at Moral Sloan Kettering and MD _%#NAME#%_."
2535,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The patient has had weakness and fatigue ongoing for 1 month and worse so in the last week bu otherwise reported no new symptoms this morning. She was sent to interventional radiology from the ED where mesenteric angiogram was performed of the SMA and the celiac vessels. This study revealed no active bleeding, no AVM, no telangiectasias and no source of GI bleeding. She is admitted to medicine following the angiogram."
2536,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"There is certainly no indication for emergency surgery at this time. I will review and discuss the CT scan with Radiology to consider possible angioplasty of the SMA. However, to my review, it seems unlikely that this would be of benefit. If the SMA can be improved, this may help prevent further attacks, however."
2537,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She was taken to the Cath lab on _%#MM2006#%_ and underwent right coronary artery stenting. She also had evaluations for her abdominal pain including MRI/MRA of the abdomen which showed evidence of SMA artery occlusion, 90% lesion stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery. It was discussed with interventional general radiology whether a stenting of this would be reasonable and ultimately her symptoms went away with treatment of her coronary artery disease and evolution of her myocardial infarction."
2538,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"The patient had history of spinal muscular atrophy since her __________, and now she flaccid weakness of lower extremities, but she was able to use her electric wheelchair and drive. She is alert, oriented, and cooperative. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) possible type A, onset at birth. 2. Recurrent right pyelonephritis and urinary tract infection. 3. Atrophic right kidney with pyelonephritis."
2539,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"PROBLEM #1: GI: She has history of diverticulitis, chronic abdominal pain, and status post partial colectomy on _%#MM#%_ 2005. Most of her symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea after eating are explained due to mesenteric ischemia secondary to SMA stenosis. She was seen by the gastroenterology physicians, who performed a colonoscopy that was negative. Moreover, they recommended abdominal ultrasound with mesenteric Dopplers that showed the SMA stenosis."
2540,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"_%#NAME#%_ reported that he had a nephew who died at approximately two years of age of spinal muscular atrophy type I. _%#NAME#%_ also had undergone SMA carrier screening which was sent to the University of Pennsylvania which was reportedly negative, thus again reducing their chance to have a child with spinal muscular atrophy."
2541,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"NEUROLOGICALLY he's sleepy but is easily alerted. He's not tremulous. LABS: Obtained preoperatively included a normal CBC and SMA 7. As above, a TSH was elevated at 9.18. A chest x-ray revealed no acute process. EKG was normal."
2542,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The mass is abutting superior mesenteric vein, but does not appear to be infiltrating the vein. There is slightly less than 50% encasement of the SMA. No infiltration into the splenic and portal veins was noted. Enlarged retroperitoneal, celiomesenteric lymph nodes were noted. There was also intrahepatic biliary dilatation."
2543,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"This was confirmed by upper EUS reportedly. There was no evidence of metastatic disease at presentation. The patient was taken for a Whipple procedure by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MMDD2007#%_. Unfortunately, there was evidence of SMA involvement at the time of surgery, and resection was aborted. He was then seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at Abbott-Northwestern during his recovery."
2544,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"2) No evidence for acute process. 3) Tiny indeterminate liver lesion. 4) Bilateral renal scarring and calcified granuloma at the right lung base. 5) Abnormal SMA was not described in the preliminary report; this is from CT of the abdomen and pelvis on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004 at 3:23."
2545,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,Findings: In the inferior mesenteric artery there was some stenosis at its origin. There was no bleeding identified along its distribution. In the SMA there was normal appearance. No bleeding identified along this distribution. 5. Ultrasound guided thoracentesis on _%#MMDD2008#%_. 6. Colonoscopy on _%#MMDD2008#%_ which showed probable ischemic colitis. Likely to be the site of bleeding.
2546,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"Previously seen to have a venous malformation at the splenic flexure by colonoscope on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002. Angiography on the day of admission, _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002, showed no abnormalities in the distribution of the SMA or IMA. He was admitted for overnight observation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. GI bleed. 2. Myelofibrosis. 3. PTCA with stent 1995."
2547,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"There may be a small saccular aneurysm off the origin of the celiac artery, but there is no hemorrhage here. There are no other calcifications appreciated in the distribution of the SMA or celiac arteries to suggest other aneurysms. There is a large area of hemorrhage in the area of the head of the pancreas and in the duodenal sweep within the mesentery that displaces the duodenal sweep, inferiorly and laterally."

2562,PD,peritoneal dialysis,"Regarding his elevated temperature, this was thought to be most likely viral in nature. However, when a repeat CRP was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, it showed an increase to 19.8 from his admission level of 10.4, blood cultures were sent as well as PD fluid analysis and culture, and antibiotics were started for a 48-hour rule out. The patient remained afebrile, and all studies came back negative and so his antibiotics were discontinued."
2563,PD,phosphate dehydrogenase,"I have discussed this with the primary-care doctor. He will confirm if this is hemolysis with hematoglobulin, and reticulocyte count. He will check a B12, folate, and ferritin level. In addition, we will check for G6 PD deficiency. We will check cryoglobulins and cold agglutinin. I have recommended that she be well hydrated and that we give her supplemental folic acid, and that the INR be corrected."

After the surgery, he had good draining from his PD catheter. However, on postoperative day #3 he again had poor draining from his catheter. He did subsequently pass one small blood clot from the catheter and after that had good drainage."
2576,PD,(device) PD,"The patient was unable to continue PD Vest treatment during this hospital course, especially the 2 days after PEG tube placement. It was offered to the patient to take pain medication so he would be able to perform his PD Vest, but the patient refused.

Following that, she did well for a long period of time; however, in early 2000 she relapsed with a platelet count of around 30,000."
2737,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"She denies any other current symptoms. She has no history of high blood pressure or renal dysfunction. The patient also has a history of low platelets thought to be either due to her SLE or to ITP. She is currently being managed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in Hematology for this.

The patient also has a known recent diagnosis of ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 72-year-old female from Nepal who is visiting one of her sons."
2741,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,He has no particular complaints aside from a fever that he feels is coming back. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of ITP treated with splenectomy in _%#MM2005#%_. 2. History of obesity treated with a gastric banding procedure in _%#MM2004#%_. Since that time he is he has lost 137 lbs.

HOSPITALIZATIONS: Secondary to his chest pain. Secondary to the ITP. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He is status post splenectomy. He did receive a Pneumovax."
2747,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Her platelets have been decreased, and this is probably from sequestration from her liver disease. Interestingly, she had been diagnosed possibly with ITP in the past, but in retrospect this is probably from her liver disease. She does not meet any criteria now for evaluation for liver transplantation."
2748,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"He came in today after a recent hospitalization at Fairview-University Medical Center where he was found to be profoundly thrombocytopenic. It was thought that he had ITP, and he responded very well to pulse prednisone therapy. However, during the course of his evaluation an HIV test was done and proved to be positive."
2749,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Several years ago, his platelet count began to dip to levels in the 20,000 to 30,000 range; this was accompanied by a very modest downward drift in his white count and hemoglobin; we elected to try treating him as though he had aplastic anemia rather than pursuing more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy for ITP specifically. He underwent a course of antithymocyte globulin, without very much benefit. He was tested at that time for Fanconi syndrome and was negative; his marrow cytogenetics were normal; he continued to have a marrow that was quite hypocellular for age."
2750,AV,atrioventricular,"She therefore was evaluated in the Emergency Department. During an attempt to self-induce vomiting at 7 p.m., she lost consciousness and ventricular fibrillation was documented on defibrillator patches. She was successfully defibrillated with a single discharge, and after brief episodes of sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block, sinus tachycardia was documented. The patient was intubated and after one episode of seizure, she recovered completely. The patient did not have any history of cardiac disease, syncope, or palpitations in the past."
2751,AV,atrioventricular,Troponin is less than 0.05. Myoglobin is 108. Chest x-ray is negative. 12 lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with first degree AV block with no evidence of ischemia. Rhythm strip did show a Wenckebach second-degree heart block. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Syncope/secondary heart block. The patient will be evaluated by Cardiology.
2752,AV,atrioventricular,"She had respiratory failure and required intubation. She currently is sedated on the respirator, maintained on dobutamine currently with the need for Neo-Synephrine earlier, and has had only Lanoxin continued previously, previously having been on Coreg 25 b.i.d., Aldactone 12 1/2 mg daily, and Cozaar 50 mg daily, to support her cardiomyopathy. She had presented in 1998 with atrial fibrillation, had an AV nodal ablation and a single lead pacemaker placed and was noted initially to have a 20% EF, which at catheterization turned out not to be related to ischemic heart disease."
2753,AV,atrioventricular,"1. Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention with Taxus drug-eluting stent 3.5 x 18 mm inflated to 18 atmospheres with pre-PTCA of that same lesion, Voyager 2.5 x 12 mm with a total of 135 cc of Optiray 350. 2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy status post bypass surgery. 3. Chronic angina. 4. Conduction disorder, complete AV block status post pacemaker implantation. 5. Diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent. 6. Hypertension. Please refer to _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_'s very detailed note from _%#MMDD2007#%_."
2754,AV,atrioventricular,"She was transferred to the ICU where she was rehydrated. She also was found to have some pauses in her atrial fibrillation. It was felt that she needed less AV blocking therapy, digoxin and beta-blocker therapy were discontinued. Therefore, she was seen in consultation by Cardiology. Thought pacemaker may be useful, however, over ensuing days with withholding her beta blocker and digoxin therapy her cardiac rhythm stabilized at an acceptable rate without significant pauses."
2755,AV,atrioventricular,"I suspect that this is more related to obesity and mild venous insufficiency. Also, the calcium blocking drug diltiazem can promote lower leg edema. 4. Slow atrial fibrillation, a combination of AV conduction system dysfunction and drug side effects. 5. Remove coronary artery disease, but her thallium study within the past year showed normal LV function, no major scars or ischemia."
2756,AV,atrioventricular,"HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Syncope: The patient was admitted to telemetry, ruled out for ischemia with three negative troponins and an EKG which showed no changes. Telemetry showed sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block, but nothing pathologic. The patient then had an echocardiogram on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which had normal EF and no wall motion abnormalities."
2757,AV,atrioventricular,"She did receive a dose of Synergyst on the day of discharge, _%#MMDD2003#%_, in order to prevent possible future episodes of RSV. The patient has no history of RSV. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trisomy 21. 2. Complete AV canal. 3. Congestive heart failure. 4. Right hip dysplasia. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Digoxin suspension 15 mcg p.o. b.i.d."
2758,AV,atrioventricular,"He had an EP study done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. He had recurring episodes of atrial fibrillation, however, therefore he had a radiofrequency ablation of the AV node. He had previously had ablation of his atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter done in _%#MM#%_ of 2005 at the VA Hospital."
2759,AV,atrioventricular,Chest x-ray was negative. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Complete heart block. Patient has underlying atrial bigeminy with complete heart block. He is not on AV nodal blockers. Blood pressure is stable. I would suggest checking a TSH to make sure there is no significant hypothyroidism.
2760,AV,atrioventricular,"She did not have any follow up arranged though Dr. _%#NAME#%_ had indicated continuation of Warfarin, use of Diltiazem and Digoxin for rate control and consideration of AV nodal ablation with permanent pacing would be an appropriate plan. The AV nodal ablation would be carried out if rate could not be controlled with Diltiazem and Digoxin."
2761,AV,atrioventricular,ASSESSMENT: This is a patient with the following issues 1. Second degree AV block. This is a gentleman with a baseline history of first degree AV block. I think that postoperatively with a small amount of hematoma and compression of the carotid this is causing him to have transient second degree AV block.
2762,AV,arteriovenous,The patient is paraplegic. He has a chronic sacral ulcer. He has a chronic Foley. He has had the PICC line in place since _%#MM#%_ and has AV fistula on his right forearm. Detailed review of systems is otherwise negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a pleasant middle-aged male in no acute distress.
2763,AV,arteriovenous,"The patient had thymoglobulin x5 doses on _%#MMDD#%_, _%#DD#%_, _%#DD#%_, _%#DD#%_ and _%#DD#%_. Plasmapheresis was delayed 1 day due to patient's left AV fistula clotting. The patient had had a non-tunneled dialysis catheter put in place for plasmapheresis. Interventional Radiology then declotted the fistula and ballooned fistula. The patient had good flow through the fistula thereafter."
2764,AV,atrioventricular,"ALLERGIES: Allergy to codeine and morphine of unknown type. She also states she is intolerant of Coumadin due to side effects which make her ""a zombie and confused."" SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a smoker but quit many years ago in 1960 and has not smoked since that time. She uses only occasional alcohol. She is retired and lives in a condominium but has continued to be quite active and has been very functional without prominent symptoms since her AV node ablation and pacemaker placement. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise, she has been feeling fairly well prior to this event."
2765,AV,atrioventricular,"No activity restrictions were recommended for this patient. He was warned not to take any more flecainide, as he is currently on sotalol. The plan for the patient in the future is possibly AV nodal ablation if sotalol does not control his atrial tachycardia."
2766,AV,arteriovenous,Evaluation showed extensive upper arm clot. Surgical debridement and/or declot was required. She did also require subclavian vein dilatation and stent placement and ultrasound a new AV fistula was placed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MMDD2003#%_. This appears to be maturing quite rapidly and should be ready for use in the next couple of weeks.
2767,AV,atrioventricular,"The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant coronary artery disease. 2. Recurrent episodes of high-grade AV block with a 7second pause while on atenolol and diltiazem. After discontinuation of these medications, the patient had a five-second episode of third degree AV block and several 2-3 second episodes of high-grade AV block."
2768,AV,arteriovenous,There is a previous occluded AV graft in more distal left arm. She was most recently seen at this hospital during _%#MM#%_ of this year with occlusion of that AV fistula that was successfully revascularized with angioplasty of the left subclavian vein. The patient has been dialyzing relatively stably since that time.
2769,AV,atrioventricular,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Showed lungs to be clear and the heart to be irregular rhythm with a regular rate. EKG on admission was normal sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block and a few PVC. T wave inversion in V1 was unchanged from prior EKG. Hemoglobin was 11. K 4.4. INR 0.94, PTT was 25, platelets 276, creatinine 8.5. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the operating room where a living related kidney transplant was performed and placement in the patient's right groin by Drs. _%#NAME#%_ and _%#NAME#%_."
2770,AV,atrioventricular,"MEDICATIONS: 1. Aspirin. 2. Diuril. 3. Aranesp. 4. Colace. 5. Protonix. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: She is afebrile. Blood pressure 107/36, mean 60, heart rate 99 AV paced. She was intubated and sedated. CARDIOVASCULAR: LVAD flow is 5.4 liters, with a fixed rate of 65 with stroke volume greater than 80 cc."
2771,AV,atrioventricular,"I do note, however, that she has underlying conduction disturbance with right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock; will have to watch for AV block on medications or if any procedures are done. At a later date we should probably look for coronary artery disease since her LV systolic function is not normal and questionable wall motion abnormalities are seen there."
2772,AV,atrioventricular,"PROCEDURES: Stress Sestamibi. Cardiology consult. ALLERGIES: Talwin provides GI upset intolerance. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Presyncope. Patient was noted to have AV block II to I, III to I and IV to I at times with a second degree AV block type II. Patient was asymptomatic through her hospital course despite this rhythm."
2773,AV,arteriovenous,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a very pleasant, 84-year-old, white male, who I have been asked to see and evaluate prior to vein patch to the right AV fistula stenosis to be done _%#MMDD#%_ by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. The patient has had two prior surgeries attempting to get a fistula that is adequate for hemodialysis, but unfortunately these have failed."
2774,AV,arteriovenous,"Pulses 2+ carotids, 1+ in feet, very difficult to palpate on the right radial and absent on the left. He has AV shunts both in the lower arm and AV shunt in the upper arm with nice hum easily palpated. CHEST: Clear with good breath sounds throughout. HEART: Normal S1, S2, +2/6 holosystolic murmur heard really throughout the chest."
2775,AV,atrioventricular,"Posterior tibial pulses were 2+ bilaterally. NEURO: The patient has positive Babinski on his left foot which is a new finding. Previous electrocardiogram showed first degree AV block, left bundle branch block, and left ventricular ____ type of pattern. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: 1. Change in mental condition. a. Rule out CVA."
2776,AV,atrioventricular,The patient has required oxygen by nasal cannula due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient was transferred to the Cardiovascular floor on postoperative day #5. He has remained with a 100% AV paced rate. He has required three to four liters of oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 90%.
2777,AV,atrioventricular,"She was originally 100% atrial and ventricular paced. With reprogramming of the AV interval, she then had atrial pacing and intact AV conduction. Her AV interval during atrial pacing was approximately 210 milliseconds. The atrial pacing unit was then turned down to 45. She had an underlying narrow complex rhythm at a rate of 60."
2778,AV,atrioventricular,He has been having no angina leading up to this incident. His first set of cardiac enzymes were normal and he his first EKG also is normal appearing apart from a first degree AV block. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Acute anterior myocardial infarction treated with lytics.
2779,AV,atrioventricular,Otherwise it is difficult to explain regional wall motion abnormalities in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient has been treated with heart failure medications. 2. Atrial flutter with 2:1 AV conduction predominantly. Cannot rule out 1:1 AV conduction. We will proceed with electrophysiology study and atrial flutter ablation.
2780,AV,atrioventricular,"There were only a couple of runs lasting 4-5 beats. Subsequent to this acute intervention, he really had no evidence of complications. He had no AV block, no heart failure, no further rhythm disturbances and no further chest pain or angina. His troponin started at 0.2, peaked at 14 and then followed a decrescendo pattern."
2781,AV,atrioventricular,"Because of continued worsening respiratory symptoms, Lyndsey was brought to Fairview-University Medical Center for admission. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Trisomy 21. 2. AV canal, status post repair. 3. Mechanical tricuspid valve, for which Lyndsey requires anticoagulation. 4. Complete heart block following AV canal repair, currently status post pacemaker placement x 2."
2782,AV,atrioventricular,"His edema he says has diminished since being in the hospital. His heart cardiac rhythm has shown sinus rhythm with first and second-degree AV block without sustained bradycardia. During sleep his heart rate in the 30s, but this would be unusual. His QRS is narrow and he has components of pain conduction system dysfunction, but at this juncture I believe there asymptomatic."
2783,AV,atrioventricular,"It appeared that the patient had sensation to light touch in all 4 extremities, but again this is limited due to aphasia. Gait examination was not performed. INVESTIGATIONS: EKG showed sinus rhythm with second-degree AV block. Cholesterol screening. Total cholesterol 126, triglycerides 75, LDL 65, HDL 46. Head CT without contrast performed on _%#MMDD#%_ showed no acute intracranial findings."
2784,AV,arteriovenous,Small bowel was decompressed. She had an MRI of the abdomen and kidneys that showed no evidence of a renal artery stenosis and no evidence of an acute abdomen. She had a renal ultrasound that showed a mild AV fistula in the lower pole of the kidney that was not significant and no evidence of renal artery stenosis on velocities.
2785,AV,atrioventricular,"In aVL, there may be flutter waves, and this could represent atrial flutter or fibrillation. She is in sinus rhythm with first degree AV block on another EKG. Telemetry is as above. ASSESSMENT: 1. An 84-year-old white female presents for syncope due to tachy-brady syndrome."
2786,AV,atrioventricular,He was monitored from _%#MMDD#%_ to _%#MMDD2007#%_. During this time he had no dizzy spells. His heart rhythm was primarily sinus with first degree AV block with episodes of second-degree AV block and Mobitz AV conduction. Because of the lack of dizziness and good medical follow-up subsequently I did not recommend that he get a pacemaker at this time.
2787,AV,atrioventricular,"LABORATORY DATA: White count 4.8, hemoglobin 8.4, MCV 67, platelets 397,000, normal differential. Chemistries are pending. EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block. Inferior Q-waves. Left axis deviation. LVH. Compared with an EKG from _%#MM#%_ these changes are not new. ASSESSMENT: 1. Colon lesion most certainly a carcinoma. 2. Anemia due to above."
2788,AV,atrioventricular,"In the emergency room, he was given oxygen and a nitroglycerin drip, and his symptoms gradually resolved. EKG showed sinus rhythm with a second-degree AV block with an interventricular conduction defect. In the emergency room, his troponin was elevated at 11.0, and a clinical impression of a subendocardial myocardial infarction was made."
2789,AV,arteriovenous,"She had no further headache which was controlled with IV morphine 2 mg and her visual acuity was fully intact with no evidence of papilledema, or AV malformations or AV nicking or silver wiring. The UA was negative for blood as well and creatinine was stable. The patient was admitted on lisinopril 20 a day as well as metoprolol 50 a day for the control of her hypertension."
2790,AV,atrioventricular,"PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Subendocardial infarction SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: 1. Atrial fibrillation. 2. AV block, second-degree. 3. Hypertension. 4. Tobacco abuse. 5. Hyperlipidemia. PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: PTCA HOSPITAL COURSE: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 70-year-old man who was admitted on _%#MMDD2004#%_ with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain."
2791,AV,atrioventricular,"HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted for supraventricular tachycardia ablation. She underwent electrophysiology study by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_. The tachycardia initially appeared to be AV node re- entrant tachycardia. After careful studying and mapping, it appeared atypical. VA was short but it was only induced on isoproterenol infusion."
2792,AV,atrioventricular,"EKG from admission to this hospital on _%#MMDD2003#%_ at 0939 hours shows atrial flutter with a controlled ventricular response. On follow up telemetry and EKG, he has had a second degree AV block (Mobitz type I) with heart rates in the 30-40 range. There are no acute ST changes. Lipid panel is normal. IMPRESSION: This patient has had multiple falls. He is documented to have intermittent sinus rhythm with first degree heart block, controlled atrial flutter and Mobitz I second degree heart block with low heart rates."
2793,AV,atrioventricular,"She has multiple myeloma and amyloidosis including restricted cardiomyopathy, history of nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infections in the past including the MRSA as above, more recently has had less urine infection problems, has had significant problems of pulmonary hypertension and chronic cardiac-related problems. She has a pacemaker in place with a prior AV node ablation and atrial fibrillation. There have been no problems with that pacemaker although it is apparently on recall and needing to be replaced."
2794,AV,atrioventricular,"Obviously, this will need to be monitored. LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies obtained today include a Chem-18 which reveals a creatinine of 1.5, BUN is 22, TSH is 1.64, sed rate is 7. ECG: Normal sinus rhythm and first degree AV block. There are Q- waves in the inferior leads as well as a poor R-wave progression across the precordium. His ECG is not significantly changed from an ECG performed _%#MMDD2001#%_."
2795,AV,atrioventricular,"The urologist agreed to plan a transurethral resection of the prostate or a TURP pending clearance from anesthesiology because of his heart condition and his MI approximately a month prior to admission. PROBLEM #3: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block, occasional PVC's, and Q-wave inversion in the lateral leads. EKG repeated on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, remained similar. EKG from _%#MM#%_ from Methodist Hospital was not available."
2796,AV,atrioventricular,"I would also increase the carvedilol medication. 2) She is not on diuretic therapy so I would add in Lasix 40 mg IV now and then 40 mg p.o. q.d. 3) Question the use of Coumadin, are there contraindications to Coumadin in this patient. The atrial fibrillation may have had a role also in her transient ischemic attack back in 2002. The AV node ablation with pacemaker does not prevent thromboembolism, as you probably know the atria are still in atrial fibrillation and can still form thrombus."
2797,AV,atrioventricular,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The past medical history has a notation of dementia, depression, chronic pain and peripherovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and GERD. The cardiac monitor notation on the ER nursing record was that she had atrial fib with PVC's noted on the cardiac monitor, however, the EKG is felt to show sinus rhythm with first degree AV block and left bundle branch blocks and left axis deviation and no PVC's were captured there. In the unit her rhythm is that of a sinus bradycardia."
2798,AV,atrioventricular,"Will for the time being treat it symptomatically. The patient could talk to an PRM and R doctor regarding this, possibly an MRI of her neck would help. Will also ask Cardiology to help determine the proper management of the paroxysmal atrial contractions and first-degree AV block."
2799,AV,atrioventricular,"While in the recovery room she was apparently hemodynamically stable but complaining of lower back pain. She does not remember any of this but while on the monitor she went from sinus rhythm with a normal PR interval to 2:1 AV block and then complete heart block that lasts for approximately 20 seconds. It is difficult to judge the end of the monitor strips because of some chest massage that was delivered, but there are 18-20 seconds of P waves at a sinus rhythm of 50-60 beats per minute with no conduction to the ventricles."
2800,IB,(stage) IB,"There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The patient has positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

PLAN: I had a detailed and thorough conversation with the patient and her daughter regarding the pathologic findings.
2850,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"1. Bronchoscopy and BAL on _%#MMDD2005#%_. Per notes, bronchoscopy revealed blood coming from the left upper lobe; however, no active bleeding at the trach site was noted. BAL fluid was consistent with no organisms seen and no growth. Cultures were negative in terms of fungal and anaerobic, as well as the regular fluid cultures."
2851,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Mr. _%#NAME#%_ defervesced on _%#MMDD2005#%_, approximately five days after his last IL2 injection. In light of persistent neutropenia, however, we are continuing broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and voriconazole. The BAL results warrant follow up, and a repeat CT should be obtained next week. PROBLEM #4: GI. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ had alternating constipation and diarrhea."
2852,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Drug screen positive for opiates, diphenhydramine. Blood cultures negative. TSH 0.98. Legionella antigen negative. Sputum culture moderate coag-negative staph. BAL fluid negative for malignancy, PCP and fungus. BAL cultures, coag-negative staph. Fungal cultures, Candida. Gram's stain positive for gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains."
2853,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"At the time of discharge, because of his MSSA, he was sent home on oral clindamycin to finish a 14-day course. At the time of this dictation, results of his BAL cultures are staphylococcus aureus, MSSA, acid-fast bacilli not yet identified and Aspergillus fumigatus. A future question about therapy concerns, treatment of this acid-fast bacilli that could be MAI since he has history of MAI."
2854,BAL,blood alcohol level,Urine pregnancy test was negative. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 27-year-old female admitted with the following: 1. Depression/anxiety with record indication of a home suicidal ideation in the setting of alcohol excess/intoxication. BAL of 0.217. Deferred to Psychiatry. 2. Alcohol dependency with unsuccessful sobriety: a. No overt signs of alcohol withdrawal presently. b. Normal liver function.
2855,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"4. Minimal fluid around the liver and the pelvis with no evidence for abdominal abscess. 5. Air present in the bladder. 3. Chest x-ray done on _%#MMDD#%_, _%#MMDD#%_, _%#MMDD#%_ and _%#MMDD#%_. 4. Bronchoscopy with BAL dated _%#MMDD2006#%_. The result of the bronchoscopy was bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal. There are no endobronchial lesions and no secretions. The examination was deemed as normal."
2856,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"We would very strongly recommend echocardiography at this time. If there is fluid there, since it is in the proximity of the consolidated lobe, one would need to consider whether or not a diagnostic tap would be helpful, because the treatment of pericarditis involves both antimicrobial drugs, as well as drainage. If the BAL of the left lower lobe is not diagnostic, then careful consideration should be, we think, given to an attempt at direct tissue biopsy of an affected part of the lung."
2857,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"At this time, her white count began to climb, and she became acidotic. Pulmonology consultation was obtained and the patient underwent bronchoscopy with BAL on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005. As per her chest x-ray, it had continued to worsen along with her clinical picture. The patient was started on fluconazole IV per pulmonary recommendations on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, as her clinical course worsened despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and with her CLL, there was a possibility of a fungal or other opportunistic infection."
2858,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Hence, a repeat bronchoscopy was undertaken about 2 weeks ago. The plan was to do both BAL and biopsy. Because of significant hypoxia, biopsy was not done at that time. The BAL cultures grew enterococcus and Aspergillus along with Candida. The cocci was also noted to be intracellular as per the BAL cell count and diff."
2859,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"At the same time, the patient was placed on Levophed due to periods of hypotension. The patient was diagnosed with ARDS secondary to Fusarium infection in the lung. The patient again underwent a BAL on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which did not show any freak bleed, but the patient was placed on steroids empirically due to increased blood and the ET tube."
2860,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"1. Ground glass appearence on CT. Ddx includes infection (viral, atypical bacterial, fungal), BOOP. Doubt CHF since echo shows normal EF. We recommend bronchoscopy with BAL to further evaluate. Patient agrees. Repeat INR stat prior to procedure. If INR >1.5, then transfuse FFP. 2. Productive cough. Likely secondary to #1. 3. Hx of pulmonary HTN secondary to HPS."
2861,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"This is concerning for malignancy. Therefore, Pulmonary was consulted and they did a bronchoscopy. However, no endobronchial lesions could be found. Eventually a BAL was done and showed some Candida, but was negative for AFB and other cultures were negative. Other bacterial cultures have remained negative, and this was thought very unlikely to be a malignant lesion."
2862,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Of note, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was on caspofungin during chemotherapy and then was started on Vfend on day zero due to the BAL on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, that had a single colony of fungus. Mr _%#NAME#%_ also had a positive C. diff culture light growth on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, and completed a 10 day course of Flagyl."
2863,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,The patient's antibiotics were tapered to intravenous Zosyn and he completed the course in the hospital. There were no positive blood cultures and the BAL did not grow any organism other than Candida albicans. The Candida was not deemed to be a pathogen. He was transferred to his assisted living facility with the arrangement of twice daily with physical therapy to assist in rehabilitation.
2864,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He has not needed any pressor support. In fact, he is slightly hypertensive. The patient also has an ongoing treatment course for a past Candida infection found from a BAL culture on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. He has been on Abelcet from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: CONSTITUTIONAL: Febrile. RESPIRATORY: Oxygen need. CARDIOVASCULAR: Stable. Blood pressures sometimes hypertensive. GASTROINTESTINAL: He had positive blood and blood clots in his stool on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ and _%#DD#%_."
2865,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Her BAL showed normal upper airway, but erythema throughout. No mucous plugs were appreciated and pink fluid was returned on the BAL. The cell counts from the BAL were 1125 rbc's with 4163 nucleated cells. Gram stain showed a few gram-negative rods and prominent PMNs. However, hyphae were also seen on the smear. She had fever on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, and considering her BAL smear and the fever, was changed over to itraconazole for fungal coverage on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004."
2866,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He also recently underwent a bronchoscopy for this decline in pulmonary function and symptomatology, but was unable to get transbronchial biopsies because of his warfarin therapy. He had no significant results from his BAL. He was also recently started back on his CellCept therapy, and as above, was given IV Solu-Medrol burst for presumed chronic rejection."
2867,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He had been receiving enzyme replacement for 12 weeks pretransplant and is getting a sibling bone marrow transplant from a sister _%#NAME#%_. Prior to this time, _%#NAME#%_ underwent a CT angiogram of the aorta, a full body CT, an MRI of the brain and spine, lumbar puncture, central line placement, ABR and BAL as well as echocardiogram, and has been doing well aside from some eczema. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: _%#NAME#%_ was the product of an uncomplicated pregnancy, labor and delivery and has been growing well with disproportionately large OFCs."
2868,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"This may be a significant pathogen or just colonizing, would doubt it as the cause of the ongoing process for several weeks.1. 2. Aspergillus apparent colonization in the BAL specimens. Significance of this is unclear. It does not fit particularly well for the several week long problems either. 2. C3. hronic obstructive lung disease. 3. C4. ongestive heart failure."
2869,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient was found to have a pulmonary hemorrhage on _%#MMDD#%_ via bronchoscopy. The patient was placed on an oscillator the next day secondary to poor oxygenation, and nitrous oxide was added. BAL cultures from _%#MMDD#%_ grew a vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium and a positive acid fast bacilli bacteria yet not identified. The patient was started on Synercid. Today, the patient has been changed from the oscillator to the conventional ventilator."
2870,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient had marked improvement on antibiotic and after being removed from the home. Given the patient's increased lymphocytes on BAL, the most likely working diagnosis is that the patient has hypersensitivity pneumonitis from exposure in the home environment. The patient also had pulmonary function tests done during his hospital stay which showed normal lung volumes and capacity."
2871,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Because the patient had complained of some mild pleuritic chest pain after the bronchoscopy was performed a CT with contrast throughout pulmonary embolism was also performed. Results as above. BAL results came back negative for any infectious causes. Therefore, triple antibiotic therapy was discontinued. The patient was given a course of ceftriaxone."
2872,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,3. Malnutrition 4. Chronic kidney disease. PROCEDURES DONE DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Chest tube placed by Intervention Radiology on _%#MMDD2007#%_ on the left side. 2. Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsy done on _%#MMDD2007#%_. CONSULTS: No consults were obtained during this hospital stay.
2873,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES THIS ADMISSION: Bronchoscopy was done on _%#MMDD2003#%_, which showed a normal surgical anastomosis in the right main stem bronchus and evidence of surgery. Otherwise, the exam was normal. BAL was obtained. The complication of this procedure was a small pneumothorax on the right side. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old female who presented to the hospital for a regular follow-up with Pulmonary."
2874,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"PROBLEM #2: Hypoxia: The patient continued to be hypoxic despite being treatment for his E. coli pneumonia. The patient underwent a repeat BAL of native lung, which had sputum cultures and BAL cultures demonstrated aspergillous fumigatus. Additionally, CT of the chest demonstrated 10 x 5 cm fluid level in the right native lung."
2875,BAL,blood alcohol level,"However, he denies having any suicidality or making any such statements and says that his last suicidal ideation was quite some time ago. He was transferred to Fairview-University Medical Center, _%#CITY#%_ campus, Emergency Department because of these statements where he was tested again and had a BAL of 0.044. He was placed on a 72-hour hold and admitted by the emergency department physician. PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above in the ""History of Present Illness."" He denies any new problems."
2876,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Fevers did subside somewhat, approximately day plus 6 and he had some intermittent fevers in between. _%#NAME#%_ did have some infectious issues during his hospitalization including a BAL that was completed _%#MMDD2007#%_ which had coagulation negative staph which was treated with vancomycin and also something that came up later, a moderate growth Paecilomyces lilacinus which sensitivity showed to be only be sensitive to Voriconazole was resistant to Caspofungin and Amphotericin B."
2877,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The next day he was dyspneic and a chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe consolidated infiltrates with effusions. His condition deteriorated and he became hypoxic. He had a BAL and was transferred to the MICU and subsequently intubated on _%#MMDD2007#%_ because of worsening hypoxia. He became oliguric with an increasing creatinine. His care was transferred to University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, because of his cardiac and transplant history."
2878,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old female with COPD who is status post right single-lung transplant on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2001. The patient was having a routine bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies and BAL. The procedure was complicated as noted above with bronchial bleeding. During the procedure, the patient also had a very transient episode of bradycardia to 45."
2879,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"It should be administered with his pancreatic enzymes. His CellCept is being held due to leukopenia and prednisone should be continued. Infectious disease. Again, BAL cultures are pending. Sputum cultures are still pending from yesterday which will be available by the end of the day today. He is afebrile and empiric antibiotics are not necessary at this moment."
2880,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"5. Virology, CMV equivocal. HSV, EBV positive. 6. Hepatitis B and C, HIV 1 and 2, HTLV 1 and 2, and RPR negative. 7. BAL revealed gram-positive cocci and clusters. Light growth Candida albicans. Moderate growth MRSA. Negative for fungus, CMV and PCP. 8. MUGA revealed ejection fraction of 59.1% and mild LV enlargement."
2881,BAL,blood alcohol level,She has no children. She has never been pregnant. She tends to isolate. Patient entered Fairview Evening Outpatient Program in _%#MM#%_ after a DWI. Her BAL was greater than .3. She progressed to the outpatient program and it was somewhat lengthened due to her having to go to school one day a week.
2882,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"I performed a bronchoscopy on _%#MMDD#%_ and it was negative for purulent secretions. Cytology on the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was negative for malignant cells and cell count on the BAL had only 80 total nucleated cells per microliter which was 22% neutrophils, 5% lymphocytes and 51% monocytes/microphages. Acid fast bacilli smear was negative on the BAL and culture grew light MRSA."
2883,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,Problem #2. Infectious disease: At the time of admission the patient had sputum culture sent and grew out moderate growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens putida group which was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Subsequent BAL grew out two strains of Pseudomonas as well as moderate growth of Candida albicans. His AFB and CMV remained negative as well as his respiratory viral culture.
2884,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,Dr. _%#NAME#%_ recommended continuing Posoconazole for now and awaiting for BAL results. She is happy to consult with us concerning BAL results and any changes that may need to be made in as antifungal therapy. The patient will also remain on IV Rocephin or empiric treatment of neutropenic fevers as well as he was placed on linezolid for moderate gram positive cocci as well as gram positive bacilli resembling diphtheroid.
2885,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"PROBLEM #6: Disseminated candidiasis. On admission, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was noted to have multiple problems with cutaneous candidiasis, most notably in her groin area. She was started on miconazole powder with good result. Of note, her BAL did grow out Candida albicans, though it was felt this was not clinically significant and so initially was not treated."
2886,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Cultures were negative for bacteria. Fungal culture shows heavy growth Candida albicans. AFB stain negative. AFB culture is in progress. There is a bronchoscopy BAL culture from _%#MMDD2005#%_ that does show light growth Candida, light growth Aspergillus, and light growth Alternaria species. See history and physical dictated _%#MMDD2005#%_ for full details of past medical history and presenting symptoms."
2887,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,I would recommend full dose treatment with voriconazole for presumed fungal infection. PLAN: Bronchoscopy with BAL today.
2888,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Bronchial cultures showed light growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus. Fungus culture showed no growth. Gram's stain showed no organisms. Analysis of the BAL fluid showed 1383 red cells, 1025 nucleated cells, 7% eosinophils, 55% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Acute interstitial pneumonitis, etiology of which is unclear at this time."
2889,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"d. This is consistent with a small vessel vasculitis including Wagener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis. PLAN: 1. Will proceed with bronchoscopy and BAL to evaluate for hemorrhage and infection. 2. High dose Solu-Medrol 250 mg IV q6h. 3. I will review this with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and rheumatology (Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_). 4. C3, C4 and CH50 complement levels."
2890,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He is a somewhat difficult historian. There is a question of head trauma from a motor vehicle accident in the past. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Recent history of loculated left lower lobe pneumonia status post BAL. Apparently, he has had problems with aspiration in the past. 2. Status post C-spine surgery. 3. Peripheral vascular disease."
2891,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He will instead be discharged on Levaquin 500 mg daily for 10 days through _%#MMDD2007#%_. Levaquin is being used empirically as the BAL cultures have been negative. The patient also is currently being treated for herpes zoster. At the time of admission, his oral Valtrex was changed to IV acyclovir."
2892,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Will add atypical coverage with Zithromax now that Levaquin has been discontinued. Await cultures and adjust. Check fungal serology panel. If no positive cultures and ongoing fever, would have a low threshold here to proceed all the way to BAL, biopsy of the right abdomen skin lesion and even bone marrow early on to look for invasive fungal disease. HISTORY: This 53-year-old male is seen in consultation from the hospitalist service and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ due to new acute afebrile illness."
2893,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Complicating her course has been a retroperitoneal hematoma, possibly in association with GJ-tube placement. She has had ascites and MRSA has also grown from that fluid in addition to urine and BAL. Palliative medicine team was asked to participate in the scheduled family care conference this afternoon at which time her status will be presented to the family with the very limited options available."
2894,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"4) Probable previous myocarditis with ongoing cardiomyopathy. 5) Previous tobacco smoker of many years with COPD. 6) History of hypertension. 7) Iatrogenic pneumothorax, _%#MM#%_ of 2003. Bronchoscopy and BAL grew out Candida, and he was treated with oral Diflucan. 8) Pulmonary embolus, _%#MM#%_ of 2003, as above. 9) In _%#MM#%_ of 2003, right forearm AV fistula placed."
2895,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient remained afebrile and vital signs stable, otherwise as noted above. She was stable for discharge on _%#MMDD2003#%_. The patient was started on Unasyn 3 gm q12h. IV on _%#MMDD2003#%_ when BAL grew out .............coccus, as well as Fluconazole 200 mg p.o. q. daily when BAL grew out yeast. The patient was changed to p.o. Augmentin on the following day."
2896,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient developed a significant progressive cough with fever. It eventually lead up to her being intubated in the Intensive Care Unit with a prolonged course. Numerous cultures, BAL, and other studies were done with no eventual diagnosis being made. The patient in fact was extremely ill during the course of this and it appeared possibly terminal at times."
2897,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"4. If she is no better with empiric antibiotics and pulmonary pressures do not preclude this, then we should do a bronchoscopy with BAL, possibly even biopsies might be indicated. 5. Initiate nebulizer therapy for history of asthma. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient is a 47-year-old female who was admitted yesterday."
2898,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,Bronchoscopy results from _%#MMDD2006#%_ include a negative Nocardia culture to date. Fungal culture is growing a moderate amount of yeast. He is growing normal flora. AFB stain is negative. BAL fluid had 3500 red cells and only 207 white cells. Respiratory viral culture from _%#MMDD2006#%_ is negative to date. RSV rapid antigen was negative.
2899,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"I agree with Cardiology consultation. 2. I agree with diuresis. 3. Follow chest x-ray (if no improvement over next 72 hours she might need more investigation which would include CT scan of chest, possible bronchoscopy with BAL if she is intubated, or even a lung biopsy depending on how she proceeds clinically). 4. BiPAP as is. 5. Follow ABG. If PCO2 rises or we cannot maintain her O2, then she will need intubation."

We checked his labs and offered him control for his blood pressure as well as his pain control."
3003,CA,cancer,"2. Chronic left pneumonitis secondary to underlying lung CA. The patient's chest x-ray shows continued extensive infiltrates. Whether this is due to his underlying lung CA versus an active infiltrate is unknown. He has relatively few symptoms of pneumonia, but given his recent chemo, his dyspnea and his elevated white count, I think it is prudent to treat him empirically with Zosyn and azithromycin."

3013,CA,carbohydrate antigen,"The suboptimal cytoreduction was secondary to a mesenteric lymph node as well as left groin node of approximately 2 cm. At that time, the patient's CA 125 was 2070. The patient underwent 6 courses of Taxol and carboplatin with a decrease in her CA 125 to 30. In _%#MM#%_ 2002, the patient was begun on consolidation therapy with weekly Taxol with a plan for 12."
3014,CA,cancer,"He has a complex urologic history which is described in the chart. He is status post left nephrectomy for renal carcinoma. He is also status post bladder CA. He has undergone cobalt treatment, which left him with recurrent ureteral obstruction. This necessitated the placement of an ileal conduit which itself had been intermittently obstructing in the past causing systematic UTIs."
3015,CA,carbohydrate antigen,"6. Call if increased pain or fever over 101. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: The patient was admitted with abdominal pain, and was found to have a 14 cm right liver mass on CT of the abdomen. CT- guided liver biopsy was performed and showed pathology consistent with her prior history of breast cancer. CA 27.29 was elevated at 73. AFP was normal at 4.2. Additionally, she had a CT of the chest, which showed either motion defect or possible filling defects in some pulmonary arteries, but lower extremity Dopplers were negative, so this was felt to be artifact."

I will also obtain CA 27.29 for primary breast cancer and evaluate her breast nodule by mammogram."
3018,CA,cancer,"ASSESSMENT: 1. Dehydration secondary to dysphagia. The dysphagia is apparently related to traumatic intubation at the time of his recent lung surgeries. It seems less likely that his weight loss is directly related to his squamous cell CA or what is felt to be low-grade lymphoma. It is possible, though less likely as well, that his poor intake is related to some other GI process, i.e. esophageal obstruction, peptic ulcer disease, etc."

IMAGING: On review of his MRI scan, the patient has significant cervical spine disease involving ligamentous hypertrophy that extends from C3 down to approximately C6. The posterior longitudinal ligament is remarkably thickened and may be calcified though this is difficult to fully assess from the MRI."
3139,C3,(complement) component 3,She is eating. Her bowels are working normally. She does have peripheral edema as well. The patient had a C3 of 56 and a C4 of 14 on _%#MMDD2006#%_. Her double-stranded DNA antibodies were greater than 200 on that day. These were repeated on _%#MMDD2006#%_. Her C3 at that point was 51 and her double-stranded DNA was down to 118.
3140,C3,cervical (level) 3,"He denied any weakness. He also had some pain in his neck that did not radiate into his arm. He denied any other pain or sensory symptoms. CT done in the emergency department was initially read as possible multilevel cervical vertebral body fractures at C3, C4, C5, and C6, with a possible fracture of the lateral mass at C5. Patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service for observation and workup."
3141,C3,(complement) component 3,"This is consistent with chronic disease. PROBLEM #6: Rheumatology/Lupus. Prior to admission on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ patient had an ANA which was 8.6, a double-stranded DNA was 233, complement C4 was 13, and complement C3 was 86. On _%#MMDD#%_ an ANA was 7.1, complement C3 82, and complement C4 was 13. Cardiolipin antibody IgG was 6.2 and IgM was 7.8. PROBLEM #7: Endocrine. Patient's PTH was slightly elevated at 234. Again, the concern is probably partial noncompliance with his medications causing it."
3142,C3,(complement) component 3,"She currently denies joint pain of any sort. Recent relevant labs include an ANA of 3.5 which is weakly positive and antidouble-stranded DNA which is negative and anti-Smith antibody which is negative. The patient's total complement and C3 were within normal limits. Her C4 is at the lower limit of normal. RPR was negative, urinalysis was negative, creatinine was 0.7 and sedimentation rate was 58."
3143,C3,(complement) component 3,"5) A diffuse vasculitis such as PAN could also provoke pulmonary symptoms such as these. RECOMMENDATIONS: I, at this time, would recommend a serologic work-up which would include an A&E with a demonstration of pattern and titer, double stranded DNA, C3, C4, SSA, SSB, Smith, RNP, sedimentation rate, CRP, both C&P ANKA. I will continue to follow with you. Thank you for this interesting consult."
3144,C3,cervical (level) 3,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Left knee replacement. 2. Left knee fusion. 3. Appendectomy. 4. Cholecystectomy. 5. Lumbar decompression. MRI shows stenosis of the cervical spine from C3 to C6. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.4. Blood pressure 115/76. Pulse 98.
3145,C3,cervical (level) 3,"She was diagnosed with meningitis and staph aureus bacteremia. A work up eventually lead to an MRI scan which identified a cervical epidural abscess, extending from C3 to C6. Evaluation by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MMDD#%_ reveals weakness of the right deltoid biceps and mild weakness of the distal right upper extremity."
3146,C3,cervical (level) 3,"CT of the spine showed no acute fractures or spinal findings; however, it did show spondylosis of the entire cervical spine and compromise of the C3, 4, and 6 nerve foramen. EKG showed ventricular pacing. LABORATORIES: His troponin was less than 0.07. Of note, on his BMP, his creatinine and BUN were elevated with a creatinine level of 2 and BUN level of 58, this was consistent with a prerenal state, and he was hydrated with 500 cc of half-normal saline, and his Lasix was decreased to 20 mg per day instead of twice a day."
3147,C3,(complement) component 3,"RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. I think we obviously will await the other laboratory tests. 2. Await the bone marrow results that was obtained today. 3. I will add some laboratory studies, including C3, DNA antibodies, CK and parvovirus titers. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 42-year-old white female who was admitted yesterday with the recent onset of a febrile illness and other issues."
3148,C3,cervical (level) 3,ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Cervical spondylitic myelopathy. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ underwent laminoplasty C3 through C7 on _%#MMDD2006#%_. There was a difficult intubation. Medicine consult was obtained. In addition intraoperative ENT consult.
3149,C3,cervical (level) 3,He presents with several-month history of decline in his muscular function of his biceps and deltoid which he is reliant on. His MRI reveals both a stenosis at C3 and a syrinx above C3 and partially below C3 also. The patient presents for elective decompression. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes only minor musculature contractures and constipation and neurogenic bladder requiring Foley catheter.
3150,PT,physical therapy,His cardiac echo is pending. The plan is to start him on anticoagulation and long-term Coumadin would be appropriateand review by cardiology. I will request a coagulopathy panel including homocysteine level. PT and OT and stroke protocol should be used. This was discussed with the patient and his wife. He has a vacation planned to Arizona in a week which I advised him to postpone if able.
3151,PT,physical therapy,"She was on TPN for some time and transferred over here for pain management, TPN and to begin her p.o. diet, as well as deconditioning. She did meet the goals of PT and OT rapidly. She frequently did go outside to smoke. Her pain control has been adequate and decreasing. Consequently, I have been able to decrease her Fentanyl, as well as her Dilaudid."
3152,PT,physical therapy,X-ray would reveal a stable peri-acetabular fracture. This was evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ of orthopedics who felt this was a stable fracture and that he could weight bear and advance PT as tolerated.
3153,PT,physical therapy,"The patient would benefit from placement in an acute rehabilitation facility for ongoing PT/OT therapies to increase his functional ADLs and mobility. Please continue with PT and OT services and speech therapy services as currently ordered while in hospital. We will follow up with this patient, but at this point I recommended placement in an acute rehab facility once he is medically stable for transfer."
3154,PT,physical therapy,"The patient's pain improved daily, and 24 hours prior to discharge the patient has only required 2 doses of oxycodone for breakthrough pain and was able to tolerate walking with her walker during therapies. The patient will be discharged home with home PT and OT to evaluate, Social Work did assist in attempts to get a stair-lift for the granddaughter's home. 2. Cardiovascular with atrial fibrillation. The patient was continued on digoxin."
3155,PT,physical therapy,PROBLEM #6: Anxiety. She may benefit from getting p.r.n. benzo and sublingual morphine. She may need a short term stay at Fairview- University Transitional Services as according to the PT recommendation and over there they can follow up her for her PT and OT evaluations and work up. PLAN: The patient needs PT and OT evaluation and treatment.
3156,PT,physical therapy,"Prior to discharge, she had been complaining of some neck tension and pain as well as stiffness. No obvious meningismus reproducible with palpation to the paraspinous muscles in the cervical region. I did ask PT to perform some myofascial tension release as well as instruct the patient on certain exercises at home. Massage at home was also encouraged. DISPOSITION: Discharged to home in a stable condition."
3157,PT,physical therapy,"Will do Duonebs. Levaquin has been started as well as prednisone. Will continue both of those, prednisone in a tapering fashion. Advised against smoking, offered assistance. PT, Social Service evaluations. Begin Advair. Dr. _%#NAME#%_, our hospital physician, will follow."
3158,PT,physical therapy,3. Neurology consultation for further workup of his syncopal episodes. 4. CT scan of brain without contrast and EEG in a.m. 5. Continue outpatient medications. 6. PT and OT evaluations once the etiology for syncope is noted or neuro/cardiovascular causes are ruled out. 7. The patient will be seen in the a.m. by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ as well as the consultants as noted above.
3159,PT,physical therapy,"He may wish to either change, adjust, or discontinue any pain medicines at that time and reassess if any nausea still exists. 3. She will have home PT, OT, and a home health aide. 4. The patient has been instructed and encouraged to use ice frequently for her left knee discomfort, as this seems to afford her the most relief."
3160,PT,physical therapy,"All suggested further cares. The patient does not want to go to a nursing home. She does have PCAs at home. We will continue with their help as well as home PT, OT and Speech Path referrals. 7. Hepatitis C. The patient's LFTs were elevated chronically. She did have a slight rise in her total bilirubin, likely related to the acute alcoholic episode."
3161,PT,physical therapy,"She was transferred to acute rehab to improve functional ability. Past medical history (as above). While on rehab, the patient remained clinically stable. Progressed satisfactorily with OT and PT as well as speech therapy. She was seen and followed by PMR staff. Addition of Lasix for increasing blood pressure as well as leg edema."
3162,PT,physical therapy,"For this he underwent a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate for giant cell arteritis, result of which is still pending at this time. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged to acute rehabilitation with PT and OT to evaluate his activity level and weight bearing status. He is discharged on a regular diet. He is to follow up with _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ of neurosurgery on _%#DDMM2007#%_ at 9 a.m. to discuss the results of his C-spine and L-spine MRI."
3163,PT,physical therapy,4. Increase celexa to 40 mg p.o. q.d. in the a.m. 5. Continue Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. 6. Decrease Decadron to 4 mg p.o. q.d. 7. Ambulate with PT b.i.d. 8. Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.a.m. 9. Discontinue Rocephin in the a.m. 10. Continue Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d. 11. Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously q.d. 12. Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d. Saturday and Sunday only.
3164,PT,physical therapy,"She is to receive skilled nursing care, and she has a good potential for rehabilitation. Her CPR status is full resuscitative measures, and she does have standing nursing home orders. She is to receive PT and OT evaluate and treat. She is to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 1 to 2 weeks. Nutrition is to continue following this patient after her discharge."
3165,PT,posterior tibial,"Femoral, DP and PT pulses are normal. Stool guaiacs in the emergency room were checked and were negative. Gastrostomy tube was negative for blood. EXTREMITIES: Warm, pink and dry; no edema. Patellar reflexes 2+. DP and PT pulses reduced. ORTHOPEDICS: Normal. SKIN: Without lesions. ASSESSMENT: 1. Anemia, probably chronic. 2. High INR due to stopping his vitamins."
3166,PT,physical therapy,2. Curettage of right proximal tibial lesion and allograft packing. CONSULTS: PT and OT. BRIEF HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: Mrs. _%#NAME#%_ is a 34-year-old female with a 6 month history of right knee pain which has become progressively worse.
3167,PT,physical therapy,"He has a tube feeding which he is getting all his nutrition for. He has been able to get up with physical therapy. He is working in PT, OT and speech and his Parkinson's medicines have been adjusted to 25:100 1 1/2 tablets every 6 hours. The patient will be discharged to home, he will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 3-4 weeks regarding the liposarcoma."
3168,PT,physical therapy,"In discussing options at disposition, the patient would prefer to go home. This was felt to be okay by Orthopaedics. He was evaluated by PT and they will determine whether or not he would benefit from either home or outpatient PT. DISPOSITION: Discharge to home in stable condition."
3169,PT,physical therapy,"She was admitted because of increased weakness in her right lower extremity greater than right upper extremity, dysarthria, difficulty with coordination on the left and an inability to transfer. She received five doses of methylprednisolone and was evaluated by OT and PT. She was initially evaluated on _%#DDMM2007#%_ by OT; that was at the start of her IV steroid therapy. Her strength in her upper extremities was deemed to 4 /5."
3170,PT,physical therapy,"SKIN: no rashes RECENT LABORATORY STUDIES: Today's BMP within normal limits with a creatinine of 1.2, White count of 10.4. INR 2.15, having recently started Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis Hemoglobin 10.2 (8.7 on _%#DDMM2007#%_ before she received packed red blood cells). ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Status post left total knee arthroplasty. - good pain control with Flexeril and Vicodin - PT and OT - Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis with a goal of 1.5-2.2. Clarify with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ how long he wants the patient to be on Coumadin."
3171,PT,physical therapy,The patient is clinically dehydrated on her physical examination. We will start some gentle IV fluids. Also check a UA and UC. We will PT and OT see her for further assessment. Will check an echocardiogram to rule out significant aortic stenosis which could be contributing to her dizziness.
3172,PT,physical therapy,"Additionally, I will get an MRI of her brain and I will allow the neurologist to decide whether or not they think she needs to have a transthoracic echo. I will have PT, OT and speech see her. It looks as though she is no longer pooling secretions and therefore I will make a dysphagia diet one available to her, but if she shows signs of aspiration, will make her n.p.o. I will also check her lipids."
3173,PT,physical therapy,"The patient said that she felt like there was a foreign body in her foot and on further examination, there appeared to be a splinter and a large fluid collection on the plantar surface of her foot. We did have Orthopedics come to remove the splinter and debride her wound which they did. PT came, looked at the patient and ordered her an orthotic. She will be discharged to rehab since we feel it is very important that the patient not do any weightbearing for several weeks so that the wound can heal."
3174,PT,physical therapy,"She had some confusion about her medications at the University Center; therefore, she was transferred to Fairview Acute Rehab Center on _%#DDMM2007#%_ for further physical and occupational therapy and also nursing cares. She was seen in consultation with PT, OT, PMR at the rehab center. The patient was insistent to go home and physical therapy felt that the patient was okay from a physical point of view to be discharged home."
3175,PT,physical therapy,4. We will give him a couple extra doses of IV Lasix to help in mobilizing some of his fluids and to ease up on his respiratory status. 5. Consult PT for strengthening exercises in order to equip the patient to be able to be discharged home. If the patient is quite weak at the end we might want to consider offering him the option of a nursing home.
3176,PT,physical therapy,Her stooling might need to be monitored and start antidiarrhea as needed due to the change of formula. 3. Activity - the patient should continue to receive OT and PT as tolerated. She should when able not lift greater than 10 pounds for 6 weeks. 4. Her trach. may be weaned as tolerated per protocol at the new hospital.
3177,PT,physical therapy,"ASSESSMENT/RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 64-year-old right-handed individual who is status post severe acute MI with poor cardiac function, status post right BKA secondary to right foot gangrene and MSSA sepsis, status post tracheostomy, status post PEG placement, status post decannulation of trach, improved swallow function, resolving pneumonia and coccyx wound issues, overall deconditioned. The patient would benefit from going to an acute rehab facility for ongoing PT, OT, and speech therapy. Estimated length of stay is approximately two to three weeks in acute Rehab. Goal is to achieve independence with ADLs and ambulation. Also to eventually be fitted for a right prosthetic leg."
3178,PT,physical therapy,"4. Hypertension. Blood pressures high end of normal of felodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d. 5. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were completed per PT and OT. 6. Low back pain. The patient developed complaints of low back pain, primarily on the right side. LS spine x-rays were obtained which indicated spondylosis, scoliosis, and disk disease on the lumbar spine."
3179,PT,physical therapy,2. Multiple Sclerosis. This was evaluated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and the patient did not require treatment for her Multiple Sclerosis during her stay. She did have PT and OT evaluation and treatment. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Discharge medications and dosages per chart.
3180,PT,physical therapy,"She was seen by occupational and physical therapy who felt the patient would benefit from further physical therapy in a TCU versus home with 24 hour observation and home PT. Beds were not available at the Minnesota Masonic Home which is the only TCU site the patient wished to consider. I discussed the case with patient's daughter, _%#NAME#%_, who assured me that she would be able to stay with the patient over the next 3-4 days at least while further assessment was undertaken."
3181,PT,physical therapy,"She was discharged with Fairview Home Care Services to assess incision, pain control as well as lab draws for INR. She will continue with physical therapy at home per Home PT. WOULD CARE: The patient should cover the incision on a p.r.n. basis."
3182,PT,physical therapy,"Dr. _%#NAME#%_ may then follow the patient's calcium/metabolic values as he sees fit. 3. The patient will be discharged with PT, OT, speech therapy, social worker, and home RN. 4. Family has agreed that the patient will go to daughter's home over the weekend, and they will check on him at least every 24 hours."
3183,PT,physical therapy,"The social worker is checking with the patient's facility to clarify their position and whether she will be allowed back in if she does not go to chemical dependency treatment after she is done with physical rehabilitation. Given the uncertainties regarding this and also the previously documented varied participation with PT and OT, I recommended a trial of a transitional subacute rehab and then if it is appropriate, the patient should be reassessed in another week for transfer to the acute rehab ward."
3184,PT,prothrombin time,"This will be restarted. Her INR will need to be rechecked on Monday. If the INR is low, her Coumadin will need to be restarted on Monday. The results of PT, PTT, INR and CBC and platelets will be faxed to Dr. ...........on _%#DDMM2003#%_ and _%#DDMM2003#%_. The patient will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_."
3185,PT,physical therapy,"At this point, he will also have a basic metabolic panel to check sodium level. 2. He will follow up with home PT and OT in order to continue rehabilitation. He also will have a home health nurse referral."
3186,PT,posterior tibial,"His ABDOMEN is soft, nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly. There is no lower extremity edema, and his pulses are 3/3 on PT and DP. There is a status post traumatic amputation of his fourth finger on the left side. His electrocardiogram shows full ventricular pacing, in the setting of atrial fibrillation."
3187,PT,physical therapy,"Given that he is having a little bit more difficulty with his speech, will also have speech eval. his swallowing. Will have PT, OT work with him since he does have the fairly significant weakness in the right leg now and plan pending this. Will also have _%#CITY#%_ Clinic of Neurology see him given the stroke through adequate anticoagulation on Coumadin and aspirin."
3188,PT,physical therapy,"Given the patient does have atrial fibrillation, a sub therapeutic transvenous ischemic attack could have occurred. At this point we have a negative head CT, unable to do an MRI because of his pacemaker. I will do PT and OT and certainly watch her further neurologic events. At this point, however, I believe TIA is unlikely. His confusion is probably related to urinary tract infection or possibly developing sepsis."
3189,PT,physical therapy,"Other problems are stable. The patient was continued with her all other medications. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Discharge home, activity as tolerated with continuation of PT and OT. Diet 1800 calorie ADA, low-salt, low-fat diet. Follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ at Fairview _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ Clinic in 1 week or sooner if worse."
3190,PT,posterior tibial,EXTREMITIES: Her left leg is wrapped. Her right leg has a large deformity on the lateral shin from her prior surgeries. There is no edema. Her radial pulse on the left was Dopplerable. DP and PT pulses on the right were Dopplerable but not palpable. EKG shows a sinus rhythm with T-wave flattening in aVL.
3191,PT,posterior tibial,"ABDOMEN: Nontender. Bowel sounds are present. EXTREMITIES: The right leg is wrapped in a dressing. Previous exam has shown no extension of the erythema or infection since surgery. Good DP and PT pulses. NEUROLOGIC: No focal motor signs. LABORATORY DATA: Hemoglobin 13.3, white count 8800, platelets 37,000. Sodium 128, K 4.2, chloride 104, CO2 19, BUN 56, creatinine 4.19. Calcium is 6.0. The ALT and AST both slightly elevated (175 and 162), alkaline phosphatase 89, albumin 2.3. Bilirubin total 1.6 mg/dl."
3192,PT,physical therapy,"1. Depressed mental status. The CT is negative. He may have had some head trauma. He has a right periorbital hematoma. We will hold his narcotics and other psychoactive medications. Will have PT and OT evaluate him. Will get a neuro consult. I'll check a B-12, TSH and VDRL. 2. Question UTI. Cultures are pending. Will treat him with Rocephin meanwhile."
3193,PT,physical therapy,"At L1, there is a lesion that is consistent with an atypical hemangioma in the vertebral body. L3-5, L4-5, L5-S1 showed disk dehydration, L4-5 herniation, L5-S1 herniation with caudal extension, all unchanged from previous. PT evaluated and treated the patient while in the hospital. Orthopedic spine surgery evaluated the patient and recommended an epidural steroid injection at L5-S1."
3194,PT,physical therapy,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Status post corpectomy for acute spinal cord compression from osteomyelitis. The patient will remain in TLSO whenever she is up or whether head of bed is elevated. She will work with PT and OT until she is independent with ADLs, follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 2 weeks. 2. Osteomyelitis without bacteriologic identification."
3195,PT,physical therapy,"2. Pain management issues. 3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She currently seems to be a bit short of breath on trinasal cannula tube, and I think she just is guarding because it hurts to deep breathe. 4. Hypertension. 5. Depression. 6. Osteoporosis. PLAN: 1. Bed rest. 2. Mobilize as is comfortable. 3. PT and OT consultation. 4. Very likely, she will require rehab center. With remote history of lung cancer, we must always be concerned about the possibility of occult malignancy."
3196,PT,physical therapy,"We will obtain a rheumatology consultation to help us in this unusual case of this older lady being diagnosed with scleroderma at such a late age. Will obtain speech, OT and PT evaluation. We note that the patient had refused a G-tube for nutrition in the past. Will also obtain a first step mattress."
3197,PT,prothrombin time,"2. _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, chest x-ray: Stable interstitial disease of the lungs. 3. Mixing study. Results: PT 1:2 INR was 1.30, PT patient INR equals 4.99. PT normal INR equals 1.01. That mixing study was done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. 4. Histone antibody study result, 1.2 (interpretation is inconclusive)"
3198,PT,physical therapy,"___________ anticoagulation with Coumadin, status post exploration of hematoma. He was admitted to acute rehab for reconditioning and rehab, including the PT and OT program. We will obtain a PM and R and PT and OT program. We will continue a tapering dose of Decadron, GI prophylaxis with Zantac. We will follow up blood sugars without coverage. The patient is to follow up in the Neurosurgery Clinic as scheduled."
3199,PT,physical therapy,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 70-year-old admitted _%#DDMM2005#%_ with right-sided weakness and decreased balance, slurred speech, questioned accentuation of prior deficits. No change on acute MRI. The patient was seen by Speech, PT, and OT and found to have mild to moderate cognitive impairment. She required minimum assist with sit to stand and ambulate with wheeled walker, and mid to moderate assist with weight shift and leg advancement, difficulties with stairs, stand-by assist with putting on socks."
3200,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"There is no hepatosplenomegaly. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are present. There is an occasional PAC. EXTREMITIES: Extremities are without edema, though the patient states that she normally has no trace edema. NEURO: The patient is alert, and oriented times three. This is a nonfocal exam."
3201,PAC,physician assistant certification,"The patient was observed and sent home with Tylenol #3 for recurrent headaches. She was followed up in the office by __________ PAC Thursday morning, noted headache had subsided but the patient was complaining of low back pain. The back pain intensified in the evening and returned to the emergency room Thursday evening with low back pain, pain in the area of where she had had the spinal tap."
3202,PAC,premature atrial contraction,Mother with dementia. No diabetes in the family. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 128/60. Pulse 100 and the monitor shows normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions (PAC). Temperature 100.6. Respiratory rate 18. GENERAL: He is thin. He is alert and oriented. He has a nasal duodenal tube in and Foley catheter.
3203,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"The decision was to intubate at the emergency room, and the patient was admitted to the MICU to evaluate his respiratory status. REMARKABLE LABS AND PROCEDURE: 1. Serial cardiac enzymes were negative. EKG: Sinus tachycardia with PAC, right axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, and no acute ST-T change. 2. CT of chest was negative for PE. Status post right pneumonectomy."
3204,PAC,post anesthesia care,"The induction of general endotracheal anesthetics as well as the procedure itself was uneventful and the patient was subsequently brought to the PAC in satisfactory condition. Postoperatively, there was note of intact motor and sensory function, as well as intact perfusion of the limb."
3205,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"KUB shows marked amount of stool throughout, no free air. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with occasional PAC. No acute ST or T-wave changes. LABS: Sodium is 137, potassium is 3.8, chloride is 102, bicarb is 24, BUN is 27, creatinine is 1.3 and glucose is 161, calcium is 8.7. White count is 7.3, hemoglobin is 10.3, platelet count is 187."
3206,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"She has clear chest to auscultation. She is grossly neurologically intact except for some slight disorientation to time. She has a regular heart rhythm with occasional PAC. Her abdomen is soft and nontender. Her pelvis is stable there are some small abrasions on her knees, but otherwise her extremities were unremarkable."
3207,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"Given his course, I think he merits early angiography. I discussed the indications, risks and alternatives of angiography and angioplasty with the patient and he elected to proceed. I will try to arrange that for today. 2. Bradycardia with pause. As noted, it is possible this is a blocked PAC. He certainly is very bradycardic with his beta blockers and these will be held at this time and will continue monitoring."
3208,PAC,physician assistant certification,"He was placed in a CAM walker this morning by Fairview Orthotics and this was changed to a fiberglass cast in neutral position at approximately 13:00 on _%#DDMM2005#%_ by myself, _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, PAC. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was discharged from the hospital. He received good p.o. analgesia and follow-up instructions. He will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in two weeks for a wound check."
3209,PAC,physician assistant certification,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic gastric bypass procedure.

3210,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"In the local ER, she was noted to have an arrhythmia that initially was interpreted as a Mobitz type II AV block. She was transferred here for further evaluation, but upon carefully evaluating the EKG from the local ER, apparently there is no second degree of AV block due to PAC, which was kind of interfering with native rhythm, causing a functional block. The patient does have some cardiac history, including history of hypertension, taking medication to control that, and two years ago a heart murmur was found consistent with aortic regurgitation."
3211,PAC,(drug) PAC,She was on multiple medications on admission 1. Diflucan 2. Aldactone 3. Risperdal 4. Lactulose 5. Slo-Mag 6. Tequin 7. She also takes Aldactone 8. Entex PAC one tablet Q day She STATES THAT She IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN AND CEPHALOSPORINS.
3212,PAC,premature atrial contraction,At the time of transfer she was changed over to formula feeds which we are going to start at 5 cc q.3h. PROBLEM #2: Cardiovascular: _%#NAME#%_ was noted to have PAC and PVC on her initial EKG along with some ST elevation. A troponin was checked and found to be 0.12 on the day of admission.
3213,PAC,physician assistant certification,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 53-year-old, Caucasian female, who has been referred into our program from her primary care provider, _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, PAC.

Radiation Oncology, Medical Oncology, and PM and R consults were obtained the next day as well as CT Surgery consult. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, a CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast was done at the request of Dr. _%#NAME#%_, the medical oncologist on the case with the following findings."
3495,PM,physical medicine and rehabilitation:PMR,9. Senokot-S 1 to 3 p.o. daily to b.i.d. p.r.n. 10. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. daily. FOLLOW UP: PM and R followup will be on an as needed as basis.

3497,PM,physical medicine and rehabilitation:PMR,"HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was admitted to the Neurology Service, and his first dose of Tegretol was held because of an elevated level of 13.9. He did show very gradual improvement throughout his stay. He was seen by Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and PM and R. Further examination and history taking revealed that these spells had happened every few months over the past 10 years, and he was usually left with some degree of residual weakness at least for a few days thereafter."
3498,PM,afternoon,3. Asthma has been stable. Continue Advair. 4. Insomnia. We will write for Restoril. Will not give Tylenol PM> 5. Dry mouth. Discussed with the patient Tylenol PM with the Benadryl most likely is causing this symptoms verses the Prilosec. 6. Anxiety. Continue her Celexa and sedation to avoid panic attack.
3499,PM,afternoon,"This was discussed with the patient, who stated that she had not had intercourse in approximately 14 years. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Senokot 1-4 p.o. b.i.d. 3. Lantus PM 25 units q.h.s. 4. Percocet 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. FOLLOW-UP: She was instructed to follow up with her primary physician for staple removal approximately seven days postoperatively."
3500,T4,thyroxine,"HEART: Regular rate and rhythm ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. EXTREMITIES: No edema. LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 137, potassium 3.8, glucose 130, calcium 8.8, TSH 10.13, T4 1.25. IMPRESSION: Hypothyroidism and Addison's disease."
3501,T4,thyroxine,"However, we need to consider the possibility of paraneoplastic conditions, myasthenia, thyroid disease or neuropathy. RECOMMENDATIONS: Labs to include paraneoplastic antibody panel, myasthenia panel, TSH, T4, B12, CPK. Plan an EMG in early part of next week. I would also recommend an MRI of the head and cervical spine which the patient refuses at the present time."
3502,T4,thyroxine,"They also recommended avoidance of alcohol, caffeine and insomnia. Of note she had a MUGA scan after chemotherapy in the spring of 2001 which was normal. PROBLEM #2: Hypothyroid. During evaluation for her palpitations, she had TSH and free T4 done. TSH was 10, and free T4 0.78. The patient will be started on levothyroxine 50 mcg p.o. q.d., and labs should be rechecked in two months."
3503,T4,thyroxine,Will treat UTI with appropriate antibiotic but will avoid Levaquin for now. She has been loaded with Dilantin and is on seizure precautions. Will check a TSH and T4.
3504,T4,thyroxine,An Endocrine Consultation was ordered to evaluate the child's elevated TSH in the context of a normal free T4. The Endocrinology Consultant stated that _%#NAME#%_'s elevated TSH may indicate a need for free T4. He presented the option of starting with 12.5 mg p.o. daily. It was thought that this might help improve _%#NAME#%_'s dry skin and slow bowel motility.
3505,T4,thyroxine,"Motor exam shows symmetric strength. Cerebellar exam is normal. Gait is normal. LABORATORY DATA: CBC is normal. Chemistry panel shows slightly low sodium at 132, TSH slightly elevated. T4 is normal. Urine tox is negative. EKG is within normal limits. ASSESSMENT: 1. Psychosis of uncertain duration with delusional thoughts and paranoia."
3506,T4,tumor stage 4,"Findings are as listed in History of Present Illness above. ASSESSMENT: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 73-year-old male with T4, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left piriform sinus. He is now 5-days status post total laryngectomy with left-neck dissection."
3507,T4,thyroxine,"On discussions with her primary doctor, they were considering starting her on Namenda for her dementia recently. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, possible hypothyroidism (last TSH was 2003, recent free T4 was on the low side of normal), peripheral vascular disease with previous leg ulcers, dementia, endometrial carcinoma and edema."
3508,T4,thyroxine,"5. Although he has no cardiac symptoms of angina, no previous cardiac problems and his echo shows normal ejection fraction, an outpatient stress study can be considered in the future given his risk factors for coronary artery disease and stenosis in the cerebral arteries. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Avoid AV nodal blockers or clonidine. 2. Make sure TSH and free T4 are normal. 3. Since he is asymptomatic with no significant pauses, I would continue conservative management. There is no absolute indication for a pacemaker at this time."
3509,T4,thyroxine,"In particular, the patient had complained of intermittent palpitations as well and will monitor for any dysrhythmias. His TSH is borderline suppressed. Will check a free T4 and monitor dysrhythmias. He will undergo serial troponins x3 and if unremarkable we will check a stress echo tomorrow. Meanwhile will also get a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy, chamber sizes and for ejection fraction."
3510,T4,thyroxine,"Normal dorsalis pedis pulses. No pedal edema. No focal foot lesions or ulcers. LABORATORY RESULTS: AST 30, ALT 21, potassium 4.2, sodium 139, TSH 0.28 (normal 0.4-5.0), free T4 is 1.05 (normal 0.7-1.85), phosphorous 2.1, lipase 585 (normal 20-250), creatinine 1.3, hemoglobin 13.0, WBC 16,500. IMPRESSION: 1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, with recent hyperglycemia."
3511,T4,thyroxine,"Next DVT prophylaxis. The patient will continue Lovenox for several days at the nursing home and call MD for further orders. 6. Macrocytic anemia. B12, folate, TSH and free T4 are all within normal limits. TSH was mildly suppressed. Normal free T4. She receives B12 injections 1 cc subq q.12h. q.2 weeks. 7. History of breast cancer followed by Minnesota Oncology. She is on Tamoxifen."
3512,T4,thyroxine,"There are some signs of progression, however, of her cognitive disabilities, and the plan at this time is to obtain an MRI to sort out the part of dementia versus recurrent cerebrovascular disease. She has a significant aphasic component. MRI, EEG, B12, T4, and TSH will be requested. Social Services will need to be involved."
3513,T4,thyroxine,"2. Neck pain, likely musculoskeletal in etiology. Recommend the use of ibuprofen or Tylenol on a p.r.n. basis. 3. Mildly decreased TSH. I doubt this represents a hyperthyroid state. We will add a T4 to the labs to rule this out. 4. I will be happy to follow up should other issues arise during the hospitalization."
3514,T4,thyroxine,"Motor, sensory, and coordination are intact. MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: Per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. LABORATORY: Labs on admission included an unremarkable Chem- 18. A TSH was 7.50. Free T4 was ordered and is pending to follow this up."
3515,T4,thyroxine,"A basic metabolic profile was all within normal limits. A CBC was also within normal limits with a preoperative hemoglobin of 13.3. Her magnesium was 2.2. Her free T4 was 2.0. Her TSH was 0.31 which is slightly below normal. A chest x-ray was normal. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, she underwent the above-named procedures."
3516,T4,thyroxine,She will plan followup with her primary care provider. Copy of labs will be provided at discharge for primary care provider review. Suppressed TSH noted. Does not appear to be hyperthyroid based on normal free T4 and T3. Thank you for consultation. Will follow up as indicated.
3517,T4,thoracic (level) 4,"The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Signal abnormality in C4 to T4 areas of the cord. The patient's MRI of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were repeated after admission, and it was determined to have signal abnormality of the C4 to the T4 cord levels."
3518,T4,thyroxine,He will also be seen today by Endocrine prior to discharge to see whether or not the dose of Synthroid needs to be adjusted. He has an elevated TSH of 47 and normal free T4. He also wanted to see a social worker prior to discharge because he considers his 2 roommates are not good company for him and therefore he will decide to move to an assisted living facility where he will be less exposed to tobacco and alcohol.
3519,T4,tumor stage 4,"She did have a low-grade temperature to 100.4 but denied any changes in her bowels or cough. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Poorly differentiated squamous cancer of the oral cavity, T4, N2, M0, stage IV diagnosed _%#MM#%_ 2003 after failure of tooth extraction to heal in _%#MM#%_ of 2002. Patient was seen by ENT in _%#MM#%_ 2003 and noted to have a necrotic lesion, and biopsy revealed cancer."
3520,T4,thoracic (level) 4,"Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, slightly tender to the right upper quadrant with no Murphy sign. There is no rebound or guarding. Spine: She had tenderness of the T1 to T4 area and had bilateral CVA tenderness. Skin was icteric. Neurologic exam was nonfocal. Extremities had no edema and 1+ bilateral pulses."
3521,T4,thyroxine,"We will follow the patient's BUN and creatinine. We will check his CBC again to see if with hydration, this drops significantly. We will check his THS and a free T4. We will maintain the patient AS DNR, DNI. We will have social work, occupational therapy and physical therapy eval uate the patient for nursing home placement."
3522,T4,thyroxine,3. New hypothyroidism. Because of generalized weakness a TSH was checked and this was elevated at 146. His free T4 was undetectable. He was started on levothyroxine replacement. This will likely need further adjustment on an outpatient basis. This certainly could also be contributing to his generalized declined and he certainly may improve with treatment.
3523,T4,tumor stage 4,"There appeared to be a clear break through the submucosal layer with lobular extension possibly into the prostate. No lymphadenopathy was seen. The patient was thus staged as an ultrasound T4 N0 M0. A CAT scan was performed the same day which showed non-specific hypodensity in the liver too small to characterize, a 9 mm hypodensity in the medial left liver lobe, likely hemangioma, multiple indeterminate small nodules within the lungs, renal stones, and an anterior mediastinal mass with thick rimmed calcifications benign in appearance."
3524,T4,tumor stage 4,"Intraoperatively a rectal biopsy revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The pelvic washings were negative for malignancy, but her primary pelvic mass was found to measure 3.9 cm in size and again was consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (a T4 lesion). Specifically it extended through the muscularis propria into the mesenteric/subserosal surfaces and also to free peritoneal surface tissues. In particular she had 7 of 23 resected lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma (N2 nodal status) and localized metastasis to the left ovary (M1 metastatic status)."
3525,T4,thyroxine,"Sensation intact to light touch. Gait within normal limits. LABORATORY DATA: Labs from _%#MMDD2007#%_ CBC normal, ALT 124, AST 73, GGT normal. Blood alcohol level 0.24. Reflex TSH 5.73, T4 normal. Sodium 145, total bilirubin zero less than 0.1. The rest of the comprehensive metabolic panel was normal. Urinalysis from _%#MMDD2007#%_ was normal. Urine tox screen from _%#MMDD2007#%_ positive for ethanol."
3526,T4,thyroxine,"She remains tachycardic, which is notably primarily due to her dehydration status, but also to some extent could be due to oral replacement of her thyroid. In reviewing the clinic labs done 3 weeks ago, she had a T4 of 1.97 and TSH of 0.52. She is a candidate for beta blocker prophylaxis during surgery, but will defer this to anesthesia given the urgency of her need for surgery."
3527,T4,thyroxine,"4. GI: The Prilosec was continued for GERD. He had no GI symptoms during his stay. 5. Endocrine: His Synthroid was continued throughout his stay. He had had a T4 and TSH checked in clinic on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. The T4 was 1.78. The TSH was 0.03. He should have this monitored per outpatient plan."
3528,T4,tumor stage 4,"Her speech is dysarthric, status post surgery. Her upper and lower extremity strength is symmetric and intact. IMPRESSION: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 66-year-old female with T4 N2b M0 squamous cell carcinoma of base of tongue with metastases to left cavernous sinus. PLAN: We have recommended single shot stereotactic radiosurgery. We discussed with the patient the indications for, as well as the risks and benefits of radiation therapy for her disease."
3529,T4,thyroxine,"Last Hgb/ RTC were 11.1/6.6 on _%#MMDD2007#%_. Her last ferritin level was 26 ng/mL on _%#MMDD2007#%_. * Endocrine: We have been following monthly thyroid functions on _%#NAME#%_. The last TSH was18.2 mU/L and free T4 was pending _%#MMDD2007#%_. No further follow-up is necessary. Discharge medications, treatments and special equipment: * Ferrous sulfate 8 mg po q 24 hours * Prevacid 1.5 mg po q 12 hours * Pear juice 5 mL po q 12 hours - to promote stooling."
3530,T4,thyroxine,"Please see admission H and P for physical exam. Pertinent laboratory on this admission showed a parathyroid hormone level of 392, calcium 11.7, phosphorus 1.9, alkaline phosphatase 221, sodium 142, potassium 3.3, BUN 32, creatinine 1.61, glucose 178. CBC was within normal limits. Vitamin D, 25 hydroxy 14. TSH 1.81, free T4 1.37, hemoglobin A1c 5.7. HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was worked up for her hypercalcemia, was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism."
3531,T4,thyroxine,"5. Hypothyroidism: As noted, we will check a TSH and keep her on her current dose of Synthroid at 200 mcg p.o. daily. If this is significantly elevated and her T3 and T4 are decreased, we will have to consider increasing her Synthroid, and maybe talk to Endocrinology about this as well. 6. Depression: The patient is currently on 1 depression medication and does show clinical signs of depression as well as bits of phrases such as, ""I would like to die because of the pain."" At this point, we will consider adding a psych consult onto her already large work-up at this time."
3532,T4,thyroxine,"We will arrange for follow-up UA/UC in seven days, results to her private medical doctor or TDU doctor for follow-up. 5. Elevation in TSH. The patient has mild elevation in the TSH at 6.41. However, the free T4 is normal at 1.16 and patient is clinically euthyroid. Most likely this is euthyroid sick syndrome."
3533,T4,thoracic (level) 4,"He also has significant abnormality in the cervical spine and T6, concerning for other lesions. IMPRESSION: Thoracic myelopathy due to a T4 compression fracture. This is an extremely difficult management condition. We discussed all the alternatives, including non-treatment which would unfortunately almost certainly result in progressive kyphotic deformity and paralysis, as renal cell is notoriously radio-resistant."
3534,T4,thyroxine,"BUN and creatinine normal at 24 and 1.23. Bilirubin is 1.4. ALT and AST normal. Hemoglobin 10.6, hematocrit 31.7, platelet count 291,000. TSH is 5.63 with free T4 1.18, which is normal. BNP 1350. Troponin-I is 0.44. pH was 7.37, pCO2 45, pO2 306 and bicarbonate of 25. Pulse ox of 98% oxygen saturations. An EKG done revealed sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block and some nonspecific ST-T changes."
3535,T4,thyroxine,3. Overall apparent good physical health. RECOMMENDATION: 1. Routine labs have been obtained and essentially normal. TSH is very slightly elevated at 5.4 which is likely not clinically significant. A free T4 will be obtained clarified this. 2. I will be able to see her during her hospitalization for concurrent medical concerns.
3536,T4,thyroxine,"The patient is discharged to be seen in followup by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 2 weeks to review these studies. Thyroid studies have also been ordered on the day of discharge including a TSH, free T3, free T4, and a thyroid ultrasound as well for evaluation of the thyroid mass. The patient is to be seen in followup at her primary clinic in one month or p.r.n. sooner."
3537,T4,thyroxine,Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is her endocrinologist and was contacted during the admission. She had seen Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in clinic earlier in the month. TSH and T4 were obtained during the hospitalization to assess this as an etiology and were normal. _%#NAME#%_ will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ to continue management of her diabetes.
3538,T4,thyroxine,8. Status post venous ligation both lower extremities. PLAN: 1. Psychiatric intervention as per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Add free T4 to screening laboratories. 3. Copy of laboratories to the patient at discharge for primary physician follow-up. If indeed iron deficient it may be reasonable to proceed with colonoscopy for completeness of workup.
3539,T4,thyroxine,"Psychiatric negative. LABORATORY DATA: INR 1.15, PTT in 30s, sodium 140, potassium 3.8, BUN 32, creatinine 1.23, ESR 35, hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 37.1, white blood count 6.4. Her last lipid profile was in _%#MM#%_, with a total cholesterol of 186, triglycerides 125, LDL 102, VLDL 25, HDL 59. TSH done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005 was low normal at 0.59, free T4 mildly decreased at 0.60, ___________ antibody within normal limits. EKG done here revealed possibly a junctional rhythm. I could not appreciate any distinct P-waves, although the baseline is a bit of poor quality, nonspecific ST changes noted."
3540,T4,thyroxine,"His urine tox screen was completely negative. PROBLEM #2: Abnormal thyroid function test. The patient's TSH was low, as mentioned above. However, his T3 and T4 were within normal limits. An Endocrine consult was placed to determine the significance of his low TSH. Their opinion was that the atrial fibrillation was not likely related to this subtle thyroid abnormality."
3541,T4,thyroxine,"The abdominal incision sites were clean, dry, and intact without erythema. The circumcision was healing well. Problem #13: Endocrine. _%#NAME#%_ developed a mildly elevated TSH and a low normal T4. Endocrine consultation was obtained. A reverse T3 level was high, confirming the suspected sick euthyroid syndrome. Repeat thyroid functions were normal on _%#MMDD2007#%_ and _%#MMDD2007#%_. This problem has resolved."
3542,T4,thyroxine,"EKG shows T-wave abnormalities in V3, V4 and 5. Her D-dimer slightly elevated at 0.8, so therefore, the patient underwent a chest CT which was negative for pulmonary embolus. Also, other labs that are significant was a TSH that is 0.04 and a free T4 of 1.55. Her CBC is normal. Her electrolytes are unremarkable. BNP is elevated at 3,270 with her previous BNP in _%#MM#%_ of 2007 of 1,440."
3543,T4,thyroxine,"PROBLEM #8: Hypothyroidism: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ has a history of subclinical hypothyroidism, which was considered to be a potential cause for her constitutional symptoms and failure to thrive. The TSH was slightly elevated at 5.35 with a free T4 of 0.78. Although, the free T4 was within normal limits; it was the recommendation of palliative care to administer a low dose of thyroid replacement to potentially improve her mood and energy level."
3544,T4,thyroxine,"2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH is currently elevated. As described above, the patient states he has been taking Synthroid as prescribed. We will not recheck a free T4 at this time because the patient has a known history of hypothyroidism. We will recheck a TSH in a few weeks while continuing his dose of Synthroid 25 mcg daily."
3545,T4,thyroxine,"Toxin was negative. Stool for O&P negative. There were a few PMNs in the stool. Other laboratories were relatively unremarkable, except for a borderline low TSH with a normal T4, at least suggesting hyperthyroidism. The patient is discharged to home. He will have follow-up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in one month and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in two to three months."
3546,T4,thoracic (level) 4,"Patient has had periods of apnea in the recovery room. In addition, he has had a progression of his spinal level up to approximately T4 after surgery. Patient denies any pain, shortness of breath, or chest pain."
3547,T4,thyroxine,"She should have had symptoms prior to the surgery, and they would have also been exacerbated in the immediate postop period, which did not occur. PLAN: We have outlined a plan. This will include obtaining a CBC, chemistry profile, free T4 and C-reactive protein, also serum cortisol level-all of these to be drawn this coming Monday morning and, thereafter, we will obtain an imaging study with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to be compared with previous CT scan from _%#MM#%_ of this year."
3548,T4,thyroxine,A follow-up MRI scan was completed due to the onset of her headaches on _%#MMDD2001#%_ which did not reveal any change from the _%#MM#%_ MRI study. She underwent visual field testing preoperatively which was normal and initial endocrine evaluation was also normal with the following levels: prolactin serum 11.8; T4 5.3; TSH 0.96; and free cortisol 1.17. She underwent the aforementioned transsphenoidal excision of the pituitary tumor with frameless stereotaxy.
3549,T4,thyroxine,"I have previously seen this patient for evaluation and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. I recommend repeat TSH, free T4 and free T3. She may have sick euthyroid syndrome which can cause problems with the T4 and T3 thyroid hormone conversion and metabolism."
3550,MR,mitral regurgitation,"She has moderate biatrial enlargement, mild LVH and left ventricular ejection fracture of 68% and RV systolic function diminished. There was a trace to mild MR and a trace pulmonic insufficiency. This combination of findings I think supports significant pulmonary hypertension and signs of right heart failure."
3551,MR,mitral regurgitation,"ADMISSION/DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Congestive heart failure. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cardiac echo, which showed EF of 55%, diastolic dysfunction, mild MR, moderate TR, mildly dilated left ventricular and left atrium, unchanged from previous echos. 2. Upper extremity doppler ultrasound, which did not show any evidence for deep venous thrombosis or any arterial flow impairment."
3552,MR,magnetic resonance,"In addition, I would further evaluate Ms. _%#NAME#%_ for any surgically accessible causes of impaired cerebrovascular blood flow. This can easily be done with carotid ultrasounds. Should the carotid ultrasounds reveal very significant stenosis, I would proceed with an MR angiogram to be sure that there was not any more distal significant stenosis which would obviate the need for surgery in her neck."
3553,MR,magnetic resonance,"We will use haloperidol for sedation as needed. We will allow the patient a liquid po diet with her improved mental status. MR scanning is appropriate. We will plan on that later today as we are able. DISCUSSION: Ms. _%#NAME#%_'s history is already well described. This unfortunate young woman has a history of adenocarcinoma of the breath, with diagnosis made apparently in 1999."
3554,MR,magnetic resonance,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Proceed with near-term IV anticoagulation with Heparin rather than antiplatelet therapy, which has been initiated by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. MR angiography of both the cervical and cranial blood vessels is a good place to start, although conventional angiography may be required to look at all the branches of the left middle cerebral and posterior cerebral distributions."
3555,MR,magnetic resonance,She had a history of fairly significant alprazolam use. This medication was stopped. She had a single non-focal seizure. Neurology was consulted. MR on CT scanning was really unremarkable. EEG was also obtained. Results are pending. She seemed to be having difficulty orienting to reality and was noted to have hallucinations.
3556,MR,mitral regurgitation,"Preliminary cardiac echo has been done which shows an EF that is normal at 55%, with akinetic inferior base and LVH. He has AS and 1+ AI with valve area preliminary of 0.8. 2+ MR is noted with some pulmonary hypertension as well. It was felt likely diastolic dysfunction was the cause of his symptoms."
3557,MR,mitral regurgitation,"3. Cor pulmonale due to emphysema, COPD, left heart failure. 4. Left heart failure due to diminished LV function, diastolic dysfunction of the LV, aortic stenosis and moderately severe MR. 5. Chronic paced in the VVI mode and mode with chronic atrial fibrillation. 6. Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinines have been 1.4 up to now 2.1. This is a really a conflict."
3558,MR,magnetic resonance,"LP tap at that time revealed what appeared to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage. She was transferred to the University Hospitals for further evaluation. Extensive evaluation by neurosurgery including CT angiogram, MR venogram, MR angiogram and digital subtraction angiogram were undertaken. There were no significant findings except for 2 areas in the bifrontal region that was thought to have imaging findings representative of small hemangiomas."
3559,MR,magnetic resonance,This young woman does have a history of migraine headaches. These have been evaluated in the past at Mayo Clinic and she previously had MRI and MR angiography done. Her current MRA is unremarkable except for an area of cephalomalacia in one segment. She is a cigarette smoker of a half a pack of cigarettes a day.
3560,MR,mitral regurgitation,"2. Congestive type heart failure _%#MM2005#%_ due to high output. 3. Severe AS. Cardiac echo done _%#MM2005#%_ showed the following, mild biatrial enlargement, RV mildly dilated and mildly dysfunctional, RV mild concentric LVH with moderate global hypokinesis with the apex having worse contractility with an EF of 40%, trace TR, mild MR, aortic valve heavily calcified with aortic valve area 0.7 cm2, with a maximum gradient of 61 mmHg and a mean gradient of 42."
3561,MR,mitral regurgitation,"PROBLEM #7: Unstable angina. The patient had developed some chest pain on his third hospital day with some EKG changes, consistent with some anterior ischemia. An echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 70-75%, no wall motion abnormalities, mild MR and a sclerotic aortic valve, without significant stenosis. The patient was initially started on heparin, his troponins were followed and were normal."
3562,MR,magnetic resonance,"At the present time, I would recommend continuing him on aspirin. Workup will include MRI of the brain to document the distribution of the stroke as well as the extent. Also MR angiography of the circle of Willis will be checked. Duplex carotid ultrasound will be checked as well. Further management depends on the outcome of the above studies."
3563,MR,magnetic resonance,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient has been loaded with fosphenytoin. I agree with that and will also recommend continuing with maintenance Dilantin which the care continued at 300 mg per day. Both free and bound phenytoin levels will be checked. As to further evaluation of the infarct, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and diffusion-weighted imaging as well as MR angiogram of the circle of Willis and cervical vessels will be checked. In addition, an echocardiogram will be checked. He will be maintained on aspirin at the present time."
3564,MR,mitral regurgitation,These subsequently came down and currently she is not requiring any medication. The patient has a loud cardiac murmur and a cardiac echo shows IHSS. Transthoracic echo showed 2+ MR with an EF of 60% with LVH. Metoprolol was added this admission. As above a transesophageal echo was done which showed no evidence of endocarditis.
3565,MR,magnetic resonance,"He was seen in clinic. The wound was cultured and he was admitted for IV antibiotics and further evaluation. He underwent an MR angiogram today and it shows good inflow down to the popliteal with poor runoff below, but he does have trifurcation demonstrated but has segmental blockage of the posterior tibial and peroneal branch of the anterior tibial, his dominant branch of the three."
3566,MR,mitral regurgitation,"The left ventricular function showed an ejection fraction of approximately 60-65% with normal response to dobutamine infusion with increased in EF of approximately 80%. Mild to moderate MR was noted on routine screening carotid Doppler. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 33 mm of Mercury right radial pressure. The patient was in addition evaluated by the EP Study and since the patient had had a prolonged QT on admission and the patient had a history of near syncope; however, the patient's QTC corrected with replacement of Potassium and it was felt that the patient did not need EP Study at this point."
3567,MR,mitral regurgitation,"Sigmoid diverticulosis was also noted. Echo preliminary shows LV size mildly increased. There is probable hypokinesis of the inferior wall with moderate MR. Ejection fraction is at least 40%. EKG demonstrates a sinus rhythm, tall R wave in V1 and V2, possibly consistent with previous posterior infarct, mild nonspecific ST-T wave changes from lead V2 to V6, probably consistent with global ischemia, mild ST depression was noted on lead II."
3568,MR,mitral regurgitation,"She has also severe aortic stenosis and moderate pulmonary hypertension with an RVSP going from 39 up to 47 mmHg. She has trace MR, moderate TR and severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area 0.6 cm2. This is more difficult to evaluate because now the deterioration and decrease in LV function."
3569,MR,magnetic resonance,I discussed my impressions with the family and they are in agreement with heparinization for now. We will also obtain an MRI of brain and MR angiogram and circle of Willis in the morning to assess the size and location of the infarct or multiple infarcts and to rule out any high-grade stenotic disease in the vertebral basilar system in view of the fluctuating symptoms she manifests.
3570,MR,magnetic resonance,"I would consider her for an MR angiogram again if she consents to this. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Await dialysis. 2. Consider repeat upper endoscopy, consider MR angiogram, consider small bowel follow-through and consider lower GI evaluation with either barium enema vs colonoscopy if her clinical status improves post dialysis."
3571,MR,magnetic resonance,Troponin was normal. TSH was 1.64 (normal). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 2. Urinalysis was unremarkable. MRI of the brain with an MR angiogram was as described above. A chest x-ray was obtained to rule out sarcoidosis and was negative. An antinuclear antibody screen was negative. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.2% (normal).
3572,MR,mitral regurgitation,She was admitted recently with volume overload and was found to have severe MR and TR in addition to her LVEF of ~25%. The decision has been made to proceed with LVAD placement as a BTT.
3573,MR,magnetic resonance,"In that case, she may require permanent pacing. It is recommended that thyroid function studies be obtained. She may require further work-up for hypertension including an MR angiogram of the abdomen. Given that the patient has ""ruled out"" for myocardial infarction, enoxaparin could be discontinued."
3574,MR,magnetic resonance,"Dr. _%#NAME#%_ from Colorectal Surgery thought that the ischemic colitis is due to decreased blood flow from high IMA ligation. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ will consider an MR angiogram in the future if his symptoms worsen. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He complained of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and dyspnea on exertion."
3575,MR,magnetic resonance,"He is admitted after recent laboratory studies were obtained in the clinic after he presented with symptoms of a two week history of left hip pain. Apparently a plane film was negative and further MR scan may have been done on an outpatient basis, results of which we are not clear on. In the meantime, he had blood work done at the clinic and was told to come for hospitalization because of a potassium of about 6 and an elevated creatinine."
3576,MR,magnetic resonance,"I suspect we are dealing with more problems over her baseline and I would be suspicious that her dehydration, urinary tract infection and cellulitis are the source of her recent decline, having an antecedent frail central nervous system. RECOMMENDATIONS: At this point in time I do not believe that MRI scanning of the brain or MR angiography is going to make much difference and would cancel that. I believe that antiplatelet therapy remains appropriate for her in any circumstance."
3577,MR,magnetic resonance,"CONSULTATIONS: Surgery and Neurology. RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES: MRI/MRA of head - normal appearing brain with no focal white matter lesions. The MR angiogram is negative. No vasculitis was identified. DISCHARGE LABS: ESR discharge of 22, rheumatoid factor less than 20, TSH 0.45, electrolytes are normal."
3578,MR,mitral regurgitation,"That EKG looks similar to today's EKG with a somewhat shorter QTC of 474 milliseconds and a QT of 520 milliseconds. An echocardiogram was done today and I have not had a chance to review it, but the preliminary report states without a measurement that she does have aortic root dilation, moderate MR, moderately severe AR, moderately severe TR, well-preserved LV function, mild RV and RA dilation, left atrial dilation, LV was not dilated."
3579,MR,magnetic resonance,Ms. _%#NAME#%_ went to the Emergency Room at Fairview Ridges Hospital where her exam showed a left hemiparesis involving the left face as well as the left upper extremity and lower extremity. An MRI of the brain was obtained as well as an MR angiogram of the head and the neck. All of these studies were entirely normal. Over the ensuing 16-18 hours Ms. _%#NAME#%_ states the pain in her neck has continued.
3580,MR,mitral regurgitation,"7. Elevated blood sugar. She did have some elevated blood sugars, but with her tapering prednisone, her blood sugars by the time of discharge were noted to be in the 120-140 range. 8. Mitral regurgitation on TEE. She was noted to have 2-3+ MR, and she will need antibiotic prophylaxis per American Heart Association's recommendations. She will need to have endocarditis prophylaxis for certain procedures."
3581,MR,mitral regurgitation,"I cannot hear carotid bruits although he should have some bruits transmitted from his heart. LUNGS: Quite clear listened supine. HEART: Shows a musical systolic ejection murmur in the aortic distribution and an MR murmur that I think at the axilla. Both are fairly high pitched, not harsh, not late peaking. ABDOMEN: He has no hepatomegaly or abdominal aortic prominence, but it does have a full abdomen."
3582,MR,mitral regurgitation,"Remarkably the LV was not dilated, but all the other chambers were. There was no LV aneurysm or LV thrombus. There was moderately severe MR, moderately severe TR and mild pulmonary hypertension, RVSP of 29 mmHg plus right atrial pressure. There was sclerosis of the aortic and mitral leaflet, but really nothing clinically significant."
3583,MR,mitral regurgitation,"EXAM: Afebrile since _%#MMDD2004#%_ when he had a temp to 100.4, blood pressure 118/70, respiration 24, pulse 87, no cervical adenopathy. NECK: Supple. LUNGS: Clear. Regular rate and rhythm with II/VI MR murmur. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. LABORATORY DATA: One AFB smear negative from _%#MMDD2004#%_."
3584,MR,magnetic resonance,"This was followed up with an MR angiogram and MRI of the brain. The brain appeared normal on diffusion, flare and T2 images. No cortical lesions were identified. The intracranial MR angiogram was normal with the exception of a tiny anterior communicating artery aneurysm (1mm). The MR angiogram of the neck revealed an 80-90% right internal carotid artery stenosis, severe disease of the origin of the right external carotid and 40-50% of the proximal left internal carotid artery stenosis."
3585,MR,magnetic resonance,6. Lasix allergy. The patient was on IV Lasix last admission and developed hives. 7. Carotid stenosis. Ultrasound sound done last admission showed severe stenosis in left internal carotid artery. MR angiography showed an 80-99% stenosis in the left internal carotid and a 70-80% on right internal carotid artery. She had a left carotid endarterectomy on _%#MMDD#%_ with Dr. _%#NAME#%_.
3586,MR,magnetic resonance,"Normoactive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Unremarkable. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA: MR angiogram of the abdomen negative. CT scan of the abdomen demonstrates distal small bowel obstruction, etiology uncertain. This may be on the basis of adhesions. ER reading suggested paralytic ileus."
3587,MR,magnetic resonance,"I believe that she should stay on aspirin. MRI scan of the brain has been scheduled and will hopefully provide some additional information as to the nature of her left frontal slowing on the EEG, as well as the questionable subdural hematoma in the frontal region. In addition, MR angiogram of the circle of Willis will be obtained looking for evidence of intracranial occlusion. Further management depends on the outcome of the above studies."
3588,MR,magnetic resonance,Recently she has had increasing difficulty with lower extremity pain and pain and discomfort in the low back region. The patient was hospitalized and has subsequently developed bladder incontinence. Evaluation has included MR scan of the spine which shows no evidence of epidural or leptomeningeal involvement. The patient has also undergone a spinal fluid tap carried out late last week.
3589,MR,mitral regurgitation,"The left circumflex had 30% proximal narrowing. 2. Echocardiogram dated _%#MMDD2007#%_, which showed normal LV size and function. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild MR. Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased to 30 plus RAP. Mild left atrial enlargement. 3. CT abdomen without contrast dated _%#MMDD2007#%_, which showed large hematoma involving the right groin, however, no evidence for intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage."
3590,MR,mitral regurgitation,"A cardiology consult was obtained after an echocardiogram was performed. The echo showed preservation of the LV function with an ejection fraction of 60%. There was mild MR, left atrial enlargement and mild increase in right ventricular systolic pressure. The cardiology service recommended that the patient obviously would continue his anticoagulation for his hypercoagulable state."
3591,MR,magnetic resonance,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Endoscopic resection of pituitary adenoma. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 44-year-old female with Cushing's disease who is status post transnasal hypophysectomy in the fall of 2006 who had continued Cushing's symptoms and an MRI suggestive of residual disease.

He is starting Decadron and thalidomide treatment for his myeloma and he is started on Decadron at 20 mg q.d. He is seen for consideration of radiation therapy to his multiple level areas of disease involvement.
3595,MR,magnetic resonance,"Neurologically, she had, however, worsened. The neurologist at the Fairview Ridges hospital evaluated her for stroke and an MRI of the brain as well as MR angiogram of the brain were completed on _%#MMDD2004#%_. The MRI revealed no acute infarct and the bilateral subdural hematomas were again unchanged."
3596,MR,magnetic resonance,She was then found to be complaining of left leg pain and was unwilling to move her left leg. Plane films were not felt to be remarkable but an MR is consistent with a nondisplaced left pubic ramus fracture. Orthopedic consultation was obtained. He recommended simply deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis of some kind and physical therapy.
3597,MR,mitral regurgitation,"He was placed on Coumadin therapy. However, a short while after discharge decided to discontinue this medication on his own. 2.
